70003,"The political situation of the Tajiks changed radically in 2001, when the United States led a coalition in overthrowing the Pashtun-dominated Taliban government. Although led by a Pashtun, Hamid Karzai, the interim government set in place by 2002 was dominated by ethnic Tajiks. Tajiks are unlikely to rebel against the central state so long as they maintain representation. However, Tajiks continue to be involved in intercommunal conflict, primarily with Pashtuns, Uzbeks, and Hazaras. Until the central government is strong enough to contain warlordism, such clashes are likely to continue. Tajiks have engaged in moderate levels of protest, a situation that is unlikely to change. However, Tajik energy seems mostly directed at conventional electoral mobilization."
61501,"Algerian Berbers possess several risk factors for rebellion. These include persistent protest in the past decade, territorial concentration, and high levels of group organization and cohesion. While Berber citizens have not been subject to harsh government repression, many Berbers hold the government responsible for not protecting them from attacks by Muslim fundamentalist militants. Despite these risks, Berber rebellion seems unlikely in the near future. Berber political organization is overwhelmingly conventional, with Berber political parties and cultural organizations focusing their energies on nonviolent protests, electoral politics, and national and international public awareness campaigns. Continued democratization of Algerian politics will also alleviate the risk of Berber rebellion.  Berber protest will probably continue so long as Berbers remain underrepresented in national politics and Tamazight remains an unofficial language. This is despite the fact that, in 1995, and again in 2002, the government recognized Tamazight as a national language. In addition, in 2000, the government created the National Pedagogic and Language Centre for the Teaching of Tamazight, and in 2005, Algerian state television launched a Berber-language television station. Nevertheless, Berbers still cannot participate fully in Algerian society without knowledge of French or Arabic. Algeria's new and unstable democracy provides ample opportunities for Berbers, particularly those in Kabylia, to protest. The issue of the Berber language is not going away and is driving a wedge between the Berbers and the secular government. This estrangement leaves the Berbers in a very difficult situation. If Islamic fundamentalists come to power, the Berbers are sure to suffer greatly. Conversely, the more the government tries to play the Arabic national card, the more the Berbers are going to suffer. For the situation to improve, the establishment of a real democracy is needed. As such, most organizations representing Berbers advocate for democratic reforms. Moves towards an electoral representation alone may result in the language issue becoming even more potent as an issue around which to garner votes. Although Berber protests since independence have been primarily nonviolent, recent events also demonstrate that violence results from certain catalysts. The assassination of Berber entertainer/nationalist Matoub Lounes in 1998 sparked riots, and annual protests (with limited instances of violence) have been held each year since. The death of a Berber youth being held in police custody in spring 2001 also sparked three months of riots, in which several dozen Berbers were killed by security forces. The incident and its aftermath mobilized several hundred thousand Berbers to take to the streets. In the lead up to the 2004 presidential election, a protest turned violent, with protestors throwing rocks and security forces using tear gas on the crowd.  These violent outbursts highlight the tension underlying Berber-Arab tensions in Algeria and are a potent warning of the possibilities for Berber rebellion if their grievances are not addressed in a meaningful way. Although Islamic fundamentalism has been forced into a retreat, it remains a threat to Berber lives, identity, language and culture. Islamic fundamentalists consider the Berbers secular, at best, and some go so far as to call them heretics. Should the Islamic fundamentalists gain power, their campaign to Islamicize the Berbers is likely to be bloody. Given Berbers continued identification with secular culture in Algeria, and the move for Berber political parties to push for a separation between Islam and the state, the Berbers continue to be important targets for the Islamic fundamentalist movement. In October, 2006, the president of the Provincial Peoples Assembly in Tizi Ouzou and Socialist Forces Front (Front des Forces Socialistes) member Raba Aissant was murdered, most likely by Islamic militants."
77101,"The Chittagong Hill Tribes possess many factors that increase the likelihood of rebellion in the future: territorial concentration; Bangladesh's limited history of democratic rule; high levels of group organization and cohesion; and Bengali repression against tribal members.  There has also been growing dissatisfaction with the lack of full implementation of the 1997 peace agreement. Factors inhibiting rebellion include efforts at negotiations and reforms between the main political party of the region and the government of Bangladesh.  Transnational support and international assistance have included the initiation of development projects by various IGOS and UN agencies.  Despite the slow implementation of the peace agreement, there has been an extremely limited amount of protest generated by tribals in 2006.  The PCJSS, ruling party of the Chittagong Regional Council, is the main channel through which the Hill people express their demands for full implementation of the peace accord.  However, this party does not represent the anti-peace accord members of the United People's Democratic Front, (UPDF), whom call for full autonomy in the region.  Still, the Bangladeshi military has continued violently repressing the tribal populations.  Some of the key issues that remain to be addressed include the creation of a commission to manage land distribution and ownership rights, the removal of the army from tribal areas, and potential limits on Bengali immigration into the hill tracts. How these issues are addressed can significantly influence tribal opposition to the agreement."
2002,"There is no reason to believe that the French Canadians outside of Quebec will be involved in militant political action in the future. They lack the organization, concentration and past history of political action that are preconditions for rebellion. Their wide dispersion and lack of organization will also limit the group's ability to protest. The fate of the French Canadians outside of Quebec is inevitably linked with those within Quebec. Attention in Canada has always been placed on negotiations between Quebec and the federal government; those outside the province are mostly ignored. This has led, for example, to grievances about the lack of French language schools outside Quebec. Nevertheless, so long as Quebec remains a part of Canada, the rest of the French population remains somewhat protected. Accordingly, any eventual solution or lack thereof of the Quebec issue will play a strong role in determining the status of French-speakers living elsewhere in Canada."
71005,"Although the Tibetans have strong transnational support from various countries, and the lack of serious armed conflicts in neighboring countries may contribute to the avoidance of rebellion, the likelihood of future Tibetan rebellion remains low to moderate. The factors suggesting future rebellion include 1) a territorial concentration and 2) a high level of group organization and cohesion. In addition, the high likelihood of rebellion remains if China 1) continues its cultural and religious restrictions and 3) insists on declining the Dalai Lama's request of regional autonomy, despite its economic development in Tibet. The likelihood of protest is also moderate, as the Tibetans have several risk factors, including ongoing political and cultural restrictions, recent repression and support from kindred groups abroad. In comparison to many ethnopolitical groups, the Tibetans continue to attract the attention of Western governments and various non-governmental organizations. Organizations such as the European Parliament regularly pass resolutions condemning China's human rights practices in Tibet. However, no country to date has challenged Beijing's claim that Tibet is a part of China. The unique role of the Dalai Lama is perhaps the major reason for Tibet's international exposure. His spiritual, non-violent approach and frequent travels around the world have not only generated much interest in Tibetan Buddhism but they also serve to maintain attention to the status of the Tibetans and Chinese practices in the region."
10004,"Four factors increase the likelihood of future indigenous protest and rebellion in Colombia: persistent protest in past decade; territorial concentration; high levels of group organization and cohesion; and government repression. Three factors favor the containment of rebellion: a recent history of democratic government and elections; transnational support for settlement; and lack of serious armed conflicts in neighboring countries. Indigenous groups in Colombia remain overwhelmingly the victims and not the antagonists of the nation's bloody civil war. However, the governments failure to secure militarized indigenous regions and to protect indigenous lands from corporate exploitation has kept the indigenous community in a state of high risk. Coupled with recent episodes of violent protest, repression and the presidential veto of the law requiring government soldiers to be tried in regular courts for human rights abuses, these failures to address indigenous demands have greatly increased the probability of future indigenous participation in violent protest and guerrilla activity. The largely ideological support expressed by external parties specifically for indigenous issues, the lack of armed conflicts across the countrys five borders and the recent succession of democratic elections are not sufficient to mitigate the risk of future rebellion."
35201,"The most recent attempt to resolve the conflict in Cyprus ' the referendum on the Annan plan in 2004  failed, with the majority of Greek Cypriots rejecting the plan and the majority of Turkish Cypriots supporting it. Given its failure, a long-term solution to the stalemate on the island is not likely in the near future. With the long history of tension between the Greek and Turkish Cypriots and Greece and Turkey proper, it is likely that some form of Turkish Cypriot protests will continue, as will the inter-communal tension and periodic violence between Turks and Greeks. Because of the large international presence on and attention dedicated to the island, it is very unlikely that the Turks will resort to militant activity, although sporadic low-level violence is possible. Turkish Cypriots are not targeted with repression, and their present political isolation is self-imposed. Therefore, the factors that usually lead to militant action are not present, beyond a history of protest. The current period of relative calm and willingness to negotiate must be capitalized on to resolve the situation on the island of Cyprus in hopes of alleviating the long-standing tensions between the Turkish and Greek Cypriots."
53001,"Afars in Ethiopia have several risk factors for rebellion, including territorial concentration and a relatively high level of group organization. With ideological encouragement from Afars residing in Djibouti and Eritrea, radical actions from the ARDUF, and a still unsettled border dispute between Ethiopia and Eritrea (although a peace agreement was formally signed between the two in December 2000), the fine line between future political protest and continued Afar rebellion remains tenuous at best. While positive remedial steps have taken place in the political arena, Ethiopia's history and demographics make the Afar a disadvantaged minority at risk, although this has not resulted in explicit government repression against non-militant Afars of late. The precarious heterogeneity of Ethiopian society, with Tigreans, Amhara, Oromo and Somalis all also vying for political power, should make the condition of the Afars in Ethiopia unresolved for years to come. Recent drought throughout Ethiopia also has exacerbated living conditions for Afars, and the spread of disease such as AIDS as well as ethnic conflict with other minorities in order to secure access to grazing lands continue to place extreme pressures on the Afar population."
22002,"The risk of rebellion by French Basques is likely to be substantially influenced by what happens in Spain. This diverges somewhat from other minorities because factors leading to increased risk of rebellion such as 1) persistent protest, 2) high levels of group organization and cohesion, 3) regime instability and 4) government repression are virtually non-existent in the French Basque territory. The French Basques are at a risk of rebellion due to the presence of persistent attacks carried out by Basques activists in neighboring Spain. The French Basques are at little risk of protest as they lack many of the risk factors for protest such as political and cultural restriction, living in an unstable democratic regime and recent repression.  When the Basques in Spain slow down their terrorist activities, the same occurs in France, and it seems that terrorist acts committed in France are often, if not always, bolstered by Spanish activists. ETA activists continue to take refuge among welcoming kindred on the French side of the border. Large quantities of weapons and explosives discovered periodically by French police seem to indicate that at least a small group of separatists is willing to continue fighting for independence, and the recent threat directed towards soccer player Bixente Lizarazu shows the attempts of separatists to put their causes on the front page of newspapers."
22004,"The Corsicans' behavior diverges from many other minority groups in that their persistent rebellion is not mirrored by many factors known to cause such rebellion, such as: 1) high levels of group organization and cohesion, 2) regime instability, 3) and government repression. While Corsicans as a people appear to be highly cohesive with high levels of territorial concentration, organizations, particularly the violent separatists, have varying levels of cohesion.  In contrast, factors that are thought to inhibit rebellion have not worked in Corsica, such as: 1) residing in a democratic regime, 2) efforts at negotiation and reform, and 3) lack of serious regional armed conflicts. The chances for containing these sporadic acts of terrorism are largely determined by how well recent reforms were accepted by conventional parties, and their ability to control the militant aspects of Corsican society. The greater threat to peace, however, seems to lie with the Corsicans themselves. Though the majority of Corsican nationalist violence does not take lives, there is a very strong criminal element intertwined with the nationalist movement, making any type of self-government seem unlikely. If the sporadic allegations that Corsican bombings are financially and criminally - rather than politically - motivated prove true, the quest for separatism may be cast in an entirely different light. In the meantime, however, the bombings seem likely to continue. Moreover, the resignation of the Minister of Interior, the rejection of formal autonomy proposals from the government to Corsicans, and political turmoil over the island do not show signs that the conflict will abate.  While the Corsicans lack many of the factors encouraging protest such as political and cultural restrictions, democratic regime instability and kindred support, recent protest activity suggests that protest may continue to be a tactic used by Corsicans. Recent repression of the group may also be a contributing factor in future protests."
75016,"Bodos have a moderate risk for rebellion, with three risk factors. They are territorially concentrated north of the Brahmaputra River in Assam and have a history of protest and violence against the state. Factors mitigating the risk of rebellion include efforts at negotiation and accommodation of Bodos demands. Two militant Bodo organizations have reached ceasefires with government officials, including in 2005 a ceasefire between the National Democratic Front of Bodoland and government. Final resolution of the conflict will depend on implementation of accords over the next several years and on eased competition between Bodo and Assamese organizations for political dominance. Bodo protest will likely continue at low to moderate levels in the near future. Numerous Bodo political organizations continue to mobilize the community, in particular students. The democratic nature of India's government also makes protest a relatively low-cost form of political resistance.  Because the agreement reached in 2003 for the Bodo Territorial Council did not take the needs of all Bodo groups into consideration, there is still a great possibility for conflict between these groups as well as uprising by the National Democratic Front of Bodoland, the groups' most radical organization. This is especially true if the talks among the NDFB and the government do not end positively."
85004,"At present, East Timor is the only ethnic group in Indonesia to have successfully mobilized during the chaos of the 1998 economic crisis and gained independence after the fall of Suharto. Its success was based on many factors, not least of which was the international attention focused on East Timor - due in large part to Portuguese pressure - which has not accompanied the conflicts by Aceh, Irian Jaya, Papua, the Moluccas, and other groups in Indonesia. East Timor=s success, however, is not necessarily guaranteed. In fact, its unique situation may contribute to future problems. As mentioned earlier, Indonesia faces separatist threats from several other groups, and greatly fears that East Timor=s success may stimulate further disintegration. The international pressure which accompanied the East Timor referendum may lead to a backlash among Indonesian political parties, some of whom feel that this solution was forced on them. Furthermore, the Indonesian army, which has been resistant to its diminished role in the democratizing republic, views its inability to keep East Timor as a lingering black eye. The border between the east and west sides of the island of Timor has already proven rather porous, and accidental conflicts between Indonesian military and militia forces and those belonging to the United Nations have already occurred. While human rights investigators and the international community press for further inquiries into past atrocities in East Timor, the Indonesian army - which perpetrated many of these crimes - is growing increasingly resentful. This tension may flare up at any time, leading to cross-border conflicts. East Timorese migrants face another significant obstacle during this transition. During the almost quarter-century occupation of the territory by Indonesia, unknown numbers of East Timorese traveled to other parts of the archipelago for educational or other opportunities. They would be easy targets for any future Indonesian nationalist backlash. Within East Timor, there are also potential problems. None the least of these is the territory itself. With no natural resources, and an infrastructure and economic base flattened by months of rioting, almost all basic necessities of the East Timorese are currently being supplied by international aid. As its residents return from refugee camps, other problems will arise. East Timor now is much more diverse than it was twenty-five years ago. Indonesian Atransmigrasi@ programs have brought Muslim and Bugis migrants, who have already clashed with ethnic East Timorese Catholics. There are also lingering tensions between the majority of Timorese, who voted for independence in August 1999, and the minority who became identified with one of the pro-Indonesia militias. While the leaders of both factions are trying hard to work together, individual families and groups still occasionally try to exact revenge for the injuries inflicted during the latter quarter of 1999. Such behavior could escalate at any time, leading to renewed violence. Presumably, the United Nations will maintain its oversight of East Timor until at least some of these problems have been resolved. The conditions of a UN pullout or transfer of power have not yet been specified, however. East Timor remains at a crucial juncture, and the actions of its leaders in the near future may have important implications for whether its population will remain at risk in the coming years."
66603,"With the new intifada ongoing since September 2000, the near-term situation for Palestinians in Israel (West Bank and Gaza) is very bleak. Since 2001, the death toll has soared as Sharon has intensified existing policies such as assassinating Palestinian militants, air strikes and incursions into Palestinian self-rule areas. Palestinian militants, meanwhile, have stepped up suicide bomb attacks in Israeli cities.  The continual spiral of suicide bombings followed by Israeli reprisal attacks shows no signs of slowing.  Violence significantly worsened in 2001 and 2002, and continued at a somewhat abated pace in 2003.  Several international attempts to bring about peace have so far failed (such as the Mitchell commission, the Saudi Peace Proposal, and the US 'Road map), and it is unlikely that violence will cease in the near-future."
32501,"It is extremely unlikely that the South Tyrolians will become involved in serious rebellion, although bombings by militants may recur. They have substantial local autonomy and have very little to gain by attempting to secede from Italy and join Austria, particularly with the lack of enthusiasm in Austria in supporting them. While they lack most of the risk factors for protest, such as political and cultural restrictions, government repression, and significant support from Austria, due to their history of protest and their deep commitments to their culture and history, nonviolent political action in the future remains a possibility. Furthermore, the effect that the increasing integration of the European Union will have on the region has yet to be determined. Thus far, it has served to help open the borders between Italy and Austria and allowed more personal exchanges between Tyrolians on both sides of the border. There are signs, however, that the German speakers in South Tyrol might try to use the EU to petition for increased autonomy or other privileges which Italy may not be willing to give."
7004,"The non-Mayan and non-Zapotec indigenous groups in Mexico demonstrate three factors that increase the likelihood of future rebellion: persistent protest in the past decade;  territorial concentration; and  increased indigenous solidarity in support of the Zapatistas. However, four factors support the strong likelihood that rebellion will be avoided: increased democratic stability under recent administrations; greater commitments of recent administrations to meet indigenous demands, backed by action; widespread public and ideological support of Mexican indigenous groups by numerous foreign governments and transnational NGOs; and lack of serious armed conflicts in neighboring countries. The prospects for peace in indigenous regions are good, primarily due to President Fox's decisive action upon election to scale back military operations in indigenous regions and his commitment to addressing the grievances of indigenous groups. Despite opposition to the Indian rights bill passed in April 2001, there is no indication that opposition will turn violent. Though the presence of pro-PRI(Institutional Revolutionary Party) paramilitary groups in indigenous regions pose a continued threat, such groups are likely to face greater constraints with the PRI unseated in the presidency and in key gubernatorial offices."
35901,"The Gagauz have virtually no risk of rebellion and, given the widespread powers afforded them as a result of the 1994 autonomy agreement, their likelihood of protest remains low. In fact, the Council of Europe originally criticized the agreement as providing too much autonomy. Nonetheless, support among residents is generally favorable and prospects for the Gagauz appear promising. Further, legislation introduced by the central government in 2005 enshrined the 1994 agreement in law, removing the last Gagauz grievance regarding autonomy. Residents of the region share a strong desire for stability and are tolerant of the moderate policies of the Gagauz councils. On the other hand, the potential for escalation of ethnic tensions cannot be totally ruled out. Renewed conflict is possible, but the risk of that occurring seems to be small. Some possible causes of conflict include a victory of hard-line Romanian nationalists in the presidency and legislature, which at the moment seems rather unlikely, or a centralization of power by the authorities in Chisinau, which has been a growing concern due to actions of the ruling Communist Party since 2001. Economic decline, which had afflicted the country since independence and threatened to aggravate tension among the population, has finally ended, and the past few years have seen weak economic growth in Gagauz Eri and the rest of the country. Another key to Gagauz stability is the Transdniestr issue in the east of the country. Thus far, the confrontation has pushed Chisinau to be accommodating towards the Gagauz out of fear of a new violent conflict in the south. This could change if the resolution of the Transdniestr conflict were to cause a backlash against the course of moderation. In this event, the gains made by the Gagauz (and also the Bulgarians) might be reversed. Further, if resolution with Transdniestr includes greater autonomous powers for that region, which seems likely, some members of the Gagauz elite could call for greater political power in the Gagauz region as well, potentially aggravating political tension."
77501,"The Rohingyas have two of the five factors that increase the chances of future rebellion: territorial concentration and recent government repression. Since the late 1980s, the military junta has negotiated ceasefire agreements with 15 ethnic groups, including the All Burma Muslim Union, which was once supported by the Rohingya community but has ceased to be active since the late 1990s. The group is now represented primarily by militant organizations, the most prominent of which is the Arakan Rohingya National Organization (ARNO). Given the severe political, economic, and cultural discrimination against the Rohingyas, it is likely that low-level resistance will reemerge in the near future."
77503,"The Kachin have three of the five factors that increase the chances of future rebellion: territorial concentration, a high level of group organization, and government repression. Factors that could limit future rebellion include the junta's negotiation of ceasefire agreements with three prominent Kachin organizations ' Kachin Independence Organization (KIO), New Democratic Army  Kachin (NDA-K), and Kachin Defense/Democratic Army (KDA)  coupled with its superior military force, which has severely limited the activities of the few remaining non-ceasefire organizations. The ceasefire deals have provided the ethnic groups with some local control and promises of economic development. Whether these provisions are fulfilled or not will also likely influence the prospects of future anti-state actions."
43603,"The Tuareg in Niger exhibit several risk factors for rebellion, including territorial concentration and regime instability in the recent past. Many of the grievances that sparked the 1990 rebellion have yet to be resolved, although some progress has been made in implementing certain provisions of the peace accord, such as a limited reintegration of former rebels into the police and military. As an example of the government reintegration plan, in 2003, many of the Republican Guard members were former Tuareg rebels. Despite consistent efforts at negotiation, some efforts at reform and transnational support for peaceful change, the Tuareg remain at high risk given the recent rebellion in 2007, which led to a government-imposed three month state of alert for the region. The state of alert has given the government increased powers of arrest.  Risk for political protest is moderate. The Tuareg lack a consistent history of political protest. However, they do suffer from continued cultural and political restrictions, largely due to historical neglect. Additionally, economic grievances remain highly salient. Unlike the Tuareg in Mali, the Tuareg of Niger remained politically organized and represented by various organizations. The peace is tenuous as insurgency seems to be arising again in the North. The amount of time the government takes to adequately uphold the agreement of the 1995 cease-fire and to provide essential resources for the Tuareg will determine the likelihood of the continuance of peace in the region. As the years go by and the Tuareg remain dissatisfied, they become increasingly prone to violence."
36504,"Before the first invasion of Chechnya, then Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev warned that an operation in Chechnya would take ""10 minutes to plan, 10 hours to execute, and 10 years to finish."" Events have proven him wrong on all three counts, for the cycle of violence was still intense at the end of 2006, although significantly diminished from earlier in the decade. Events change rapidly in Chechnya, but by 2007 rebel forces were reliably numbered at more than 1,000 and rebel attacks against government forces were still reported on an almost daily basis, despite a formal declaration by Russia's government that the military campaign is over and a period of ""normalization"" has begun. Most rebel attacks are now hit-and-run operations. The years 2004 to 2006 were a period of great change for the rebels. While the rebels managed one spectacular hostage taking in 2004 (a school in Beslan, North Ossetia), this proved to be their last, as two high-profile rebel leaders ' Maskhadov and Basayev  were killed by state security forces. Rebels also managed to assassinate pro-Kremlin Chechen leader Akhmad Kadyrov in 2004. This, however, brought his son, Ramzan, to power and he has slowly consolidated control of the region with Kremlin support, bringing rebel fighters slowly under control through a combination of cooptation and repression. In a sense, the Kremlin has ""outsourced"" the pacification of Chechnya to an indigenous group of Chechens led by Kadyrov and, to date, it has seen some success. The Chechens have several risk factors for future rebellion: territorial concentration, recent government repression, a recent history of rebellion and group cohesion. The most likely scenario going forward will be increased calm in the region with limited violence continuing into the future. The risks of renewed large-scale violence are twofold: first, if Kadyrov loses support form the Kremlin there is great potential for a power struggle between Grozny and Moscow; second, there has been increased regional instability in neighboring republics of Ingushetia, Dagestan and beyond where insurgencies and violence have been gathering pace. This instability has the potential to spill over into Chechnya itself."
36537,"Tuvinians are unlikely to engage in violent rebellion in the near future. Protest in the previous 10 years has been almost non-existent, and group members have demonstrated no signs of violence against the state or other ethnic groups. While the Tuva are territorially concentrated, constitute a majority of the republic's population, and have a moderately strong identity, they nevertheless exhibit relatively low levels of group organization. The only noticeable protest of late occurred in 2002 over Russia's decision to deny the Dalai Lama a visa to enter the region, but the protests were small. The absence of any other significant political or cultural restrictions mean that protests will probably not escalate into mass protests. There is widespread poverty among the group, but Moscow provides substantial subsidies for the autonomous republics budget."
78002,"Political violence by some elements of the Sri Lankan Tamil population is highly likely to continue in the near future. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE or Tamil Tigers), the dominant Tamil organization in Sri Lanka, has resumed its protracted insurgency against the central government following the collapse of a fragile ceasefire in 2005. In 2006, the conflict intensified to become a civil war. Many other risk factors exist for future violence, including heavy repression of both violent and civilian Tamils, Tamil conflict with multiple other ethnic groups, and severe factional violence among Tamils. The likelihood of continued violence is further increased by the territorial concentration of the Tamils, the group's history of lost autonomy and its long and active separatist movement. Through a network of Tamil diaspora groups, the LTTE continues to obtain the material and military resources necessary to prolong the conflict. Therefore, the prospects for peace in the near future between the LTTE and the Sri Lankan government are dim. The effectiveness, in terms of instilling peace in the region, of the government's recent success in recapturing LTTE territory remains unclear as the organization operates behind a network of transnational support."
71301,"There has been no rebellion among the aboriginal Taiwanese. Although there have been increased protests in recent years, rebellion is unlikely because of several factors: 1) the Taiwanese government's democratic regime; 2) the government's efforts to improve the group's situation, and 3) the lack of serious armed conflicts in nearby countries that might have spillover effects on aboriginal Taiwanese. The government's competition with the People's Republic of China may provide the rationale for future improvements in aboriginals' status. Like indigenous peoples in many other areas of the world, Taiwan's aboriginals face threats to their culture and lifeways and a continual encroachment on their traditional areas of residence. Although aboriginals are not subject to any official discrimination, they are unable to influence policies and programs that affect their ways of life. Taiwan's rapid economic modernization displaced many aboriginals from their home areas while simultaneously providing them with limited economic benefits. The average income of the aboriginals is less than half of the national average. Poverty and the increasing inability to earn a livelihood through traditional methods such as hunting and felling trees have helped to promote widespread child prostitution and alcoholism. Further, Taiwan's indigenous peoples have become ""tourist attractions"" as the government has moved many groups into ""model"" villages in order to boost visitors to the island."
64005,"The situation of the Kurds in Turkey has slightly improved in the past few years, although significant obstacles remain and Kurds still present a number of the risk factors for future rebellion, such as current rebellion and protest, territorial concentration, high levels of group organization, and repression. They also face serious discrimination. Kurds are denied autonomy and military skirmishes continue to occur between the PKK and government forces (having claimed more than 30,000 victims to date). Turkey's Kurds still suffer from discrimination that includes serious restrictions on their language and any expression of Kurdish culture, as well as restrictions on non-violent political organizing. These restrictions are enforced at times by mass arrest. The greatest hope for Kurdish rights likely will stem from the international arena, as Turkish policies have been criticized by Turkey's NATO allies and are a barrier to Turkey's economic integration into Europe. For the time being at least, Turkey seems to be willing to pay this price in order to counter the perceived threat posed by the Kurds to its national security, but further international pressures may eventually help the Kurds of Turkey gain greater minority rights."
36905,"Crimean Russians exhibit four of the five factors that encourage rebellion: persistent protest; territorial concentration; high levels of group organization and cohesion; and recent regime instability during the Orange Revolution of November 2004 - January 2005. However, the high degree of autonomy granted to the Crimean government by Ukraine and the fact that Crimean Russians are subject to no state repression and very little societal discrimination have served to alleviate some grievances. Furthermore, while there is some sentiment in both Russia and Crimea for Russia's annexation of Crimea, it is unlikely that Russias central government will pursue this goal. Ethnic Russians in Crimea are likely to continue to protest at moderate levels. There is little indication that the central government is going to change unfavorable policies (e.g. state-level language laws and policies regarding Tatar immigration) in the near future. The highest risk for violence in Crimea is between ethnic Russian and Tatar groups. Limited incidents of violence between these groups have occurred sporadically in recent years. With the increase of the Tatar population (and hence increased pressure on the Russian population and on economic resources), these incidences are likely to increase, barring more vigorous intervention by the central government or other actors."
203,"Although there has been a history of militant activity in the past, it is unlikely that Native Americans in the United States will use this strategy in the future. While unlikely, it is impossible to rule out such action entirely. The group's economic situation is extremely poor, and there does not appear to be a lot of hope for a reversal of this situation any time soon. The group does not possess the risk factors usually associated with protest, such as repression, political and cultural restrictions or a fragile democracy, but protest is likely. The group has used protest throughout the past century and is likely to continue. The indigenous movement has gained attention throughout the world, and the Native Americans have numerous issues which need to be addressed. Native Americans are among the poorest, least educated people in the country and suffer from sub-standard health and housing conditions. In large part, this is not due to current discrimination but, rather is a result of past government discrimination and the conditions of life on reservations. At the same time, however, there is some discrimination in society. Affirmative action programs created by state and federal governments to alleviate discrimination seem to be a double-edged sword for Native Americans. While they do not seem to benefit from these programs as much as other ethnic groups do, they do suffer from the backlash which affirmative action has engendered among whites and others with more strictly merit-oriented inclinations. Until these issues and various land rights are resolved, the likelihood of continued protests is high."
81604,"The Montagnards (also known as the Dega or Degar people) have two factors that may increase the likelihood of rebellion in the future: territorial concentration and repression by the government. There are fewer than a million Montagnards remaining in Vietnam. Very little information is available on the status of these hill peoples. They appear to still remain outside of the mainstream of Vietnamese life, maintaining their own dialects and surviving on subsistence agriculture.  Recent years have seen several large protests occur, notably in 2001 and 2004, that were met with serious force from the government. However, it appears highly unlikely that there will be a rebellion in the near future, as the most recent protest was reportedly conducted in a peaceful manner."
34501,"Kosovar Albanians in the former Yugoslavia exhibit three of the five characteristics that encourage future rebellion: persistent protest in the past, territorial concentration and generally high levels of group organization. However, the unilateral Kosovar declaration of independence in early 2008 was followed by high levels of international recognition, including by most of the member states of NATO, the EU and OSCE. However, the Republic of Kosovo has not applied for membership to the United Nations, due to opposition from Russia, which holds a veto on the UN Security Council.  The future of Kosovo, and hence of Kosovar Albanians, is in part dependent on two factors. First, the relationship with Serbia, which does not recognize Kosovar independence, continues to be tense. However, with radical nationalists out of power, the situation is not likely to escalate to violence. However, violence is likely between Kosovar Albanians and Kosovar Serbs. Intercommunal violence has been a recurrent problem within Kosovo; and although some steps have been taken to improve relations, they have thus far been unsuccessful.  "
55102,"The Lozi are at moderate risk for future rebellion. They have lost autonomy, an important risk factor for rebellion. In addition, they have had persistent past protest (although not recently) and suffer from repression. These three factors indicate grievances are not being redressed, making rebellion more likely. Lozi are territorially concentrated in the Western Province and have a high level of group identity. Talk of seccession and political independence exist among the group. However, this sentiment is only shared by a smaller number of Lozis, where many others do not see this stance as an advantageous one. However, the internal fighting and lack of commitment to Lozi organizations will hinder any efforts. Of note, kindred Barotse in the Caprivi Strip of Namibia rebelled in 1998, and there has been talk between the two since then. A joint insurrection is possible. Members of the Barotse Patriotic Front in Zambia even crossed the border to help fight in Namibia in 1999. There are some mitigating factors. The Zambian government has been moving towards more democratic processes since Chiluba stepped down in 2001. There is also increasing transnational pressure on Zambia to maintain democratization. Recent years have also seen direct aid from foreign governments to Lozi health and development projects, alleviating some Lozi grievances. Lozi risk for protest is also moderate, fueled by continuing grievance but hampered by lack of coherent Lozi organizations."
90001,"There is little reason to believe that the Aborigines of Australian will employ militant tactics or systematic violence in the near future. They lack the risk factors -- such as territorial concentration, group cohesion, regime instability and government repression -- that make rebellion more likely. At the same time, factors that mitigate risks of militant behavior, including living under a consolidated democracy and continued efforts at reforms, are present. The government continues to try to make amends for past wrongs, including a issuing a formal apology for past wrongs committed against the aboriginal community. While the risk of militant activity is low, the possibility for continued protests is higher. This is despite the fact that the Aborigines do not possess the normal risk factors associated with protest, such as government repression, political restrictions, or a new democracy. The openness of the Australian democratic system allows for the group to protest, and they have used the strategy throughout the past. There are still many issues outstanding and the Aboriginal community continues to suffer economically and socially. While the Australian government has placed millions of dollars into programs to both improve the Aboriginal economic status, and to provide sensitivity training for the white population, there is still discrimination throughout the country. Until these problems are adequately addressed, protests are likely to continue."
76001,"The Lhotshampas have the following factors encouraging rebellion or protest: territorial concentration in southern Bhutan, where they constitute a majority of the population, and significant political, economic, and cultural discrimination. As of the end of 2006, the leaders of Nepal and Bhutan remained in talks regarding the repatriation of Bhutanese refugees in Nepal."
34602,"Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) have a low risk of rebellion, yet the possibility of protests remains moderate. Croat protests tend to be symbolic in nature. The Croats have a significant degree of group cohesion and have at least eight political parties. While there are some extreme Croats nationalists who demand that a third Croat-controlled entity be established to balance Croats interests against Bosniaks and Serbs, most simply want equal treatment under the law.  The Croats in BiH have only a few of the risk factors for rebellion, including the presence of regime instability and high levels of group organization. Moreover, several factors -- most significantly, transnational support for reform and reconciliation -- inhibit rebellion. While elections are free and fair, full democracy is still a work in progress in BiH. The High Representative of the international community in BiH still holds the so-called 'Bonn Powers that allow him to intervene at any level of BiH government to assist in the full implementation of the Dayton Accords, which means everything from the removing obstructionist politicians to imposing laws. Additionally, foreign peacekeepers remain in BiH. In 2004, NATOs SFOR officially turned over its mission in BiH to the European Unions EUFOR, which has approximately 7,000 troops on the ground. Furthermore, there has been no serious armed conflict in the region since 1999. For these three reasons, among others, rebellion appears extremely unlikely for Croats in BiH in the near future.  The only significant risk factor for protest in the Croat case is the new and unstable nature of democracy in BiH. There are no official political and cultural restrictions against Croats, however, in areas in which they are a minority, some have reported informal restrictions on their ability to worship as they like. While Croatia has provided limited support to BiH Croats, the Croatian government is now reluctant to interfere in the political affairs of BiH. The government in BiH is still not stable on its own without the support and oversight of the international community. There are significant attempts to alter the Constitution established under the Dayton Accords, but there is little agreement on how it should be changed. The current constitutional arrangement is cumbersome, expensive and not workable in the long-term."
2001,"The Quebecois are at a very low risk for violent rebellion. Although a separatist movement has persisted in Quebec for many years, it has not employed violence to achieve its goals since the 1970s. They live under a democratic regime that is actively involved with negotiated policies related to the state of the group. The Quebecois are also not repressed by the Canadian government, which makes many efforts to appease the demands of the Quebecois, particularly on the provincial level. They do not suffer from political and cultural restrictions, and in fact, the culture of the Quebecois is often protected, if not supported directly, by law. The Quebecois do have a high territorial concentration and high levels of group cohesion and organization. However, this is only like to lead to protests on the same level as in the past and not lead to an outbreak of violence. Most recent protests have been aimed at the provincial government that has not been as sympathetic to calls for autonomy and secession as previous governments. The politicians who lead the Qu'bécois political parties find it in their best interest to continue to press for more power vis-à-vis the Ottawa government and to make the case to Québécois that the province would be better off on its own. As Quebec continues to perform well economically, the confidence of the Québécois in their ability to survive as an independent country could also grow  leading to greater protest. In particular, the Quebec nationalist elite believe, with some justification, that a sovereign Quebec could expect to negotiate status within NAFTA and the Free Trade Area for the Americas. Also, a 2006 parliamentary resolution recognizing Quebec as a distinct nation within Canada could provide a basis for future calls for independence.  The role of allophones, or immigrants who speak a language other than French or English, in Quebecs future is unclear, although they have tended to side with Anglophone Quebecers in the past. What impact these cross-currents will have on the future of Quebec politics is uncertain, but it seems likely that they are diluting the group cohesion that would be necessary for a sustained push for independence."
71002,"There have not been significant protests or rebellion by the Hui in recent decades. Several indicators suggest why: there are 1) low levels of group concentration, organization and cohesion; 2) government efforts to accommodate Hui cultural interests; and 3) no significant government repression. Further, the Chinese government's efforts in developing the western provinces, and the need for Arabic language skills due to Chinas increasing interaction with the Middle East, may contribute to improvements in the Hui economic status. The major pressure point is cultural discrimination and economic disparity, which may provoke sporadic clashes between the Hui and other ethnic groups, or protests to the Chinese government. Chances of rebellion are low."
13003,"Low-level rebellion by lowland indigenous groups is likely to continue based on five factors : persistent protest in the past; territorial concentration; high level of group cohesion; regime instability in the last five years; and ;government repression. However, efforts at negotiation and reform, as well as transnational support for the indigenous of the Amazon, significantly inhibit the escalation of violence.  Although economic and political discrimination against indigenous people seems likely to persist in the near future, indigenous groups have proved capable of sustained resistance to unfair economic and political policies, especially those that cut social aid programs. Based on previous organization levels, continued organization and mobilization appears quite likely; since 2001 they have continued to express their demands to national and international communities, though their effectiveness remains unproven as significant improvement in their situation has not happened yet. As the Ecuadorian government pursues implementation of economic reforms that cut social aid, indigenous groups in the Amazon are likely to organize against the government, as the vast majority did when they backed out of a coalition with President Gutierrez in 2003 over his abandonment of promised economic policies. Continued commercial development of their lands can also be expected to ignite mobilization and rebellion. These protests have escalated in some violence since 2001, and scattered violence is likely so long as oil companies continue to infringe upon indigenous land. Perhaps the most effective means to improve their situation in Ecuador is if the indigenous can continue to increase and maintain their role in the parliament."
37201,"The Abkhaz exhibit many factors that increase the likelihood of conflict in the future if the dispute over the status of Abhazia remains unresolved: the group has experienced both repression and rebellion in the recent past; it is highly organized both militarily and politically; and is the vast majority of Abkhaz are concentrated in a distinct region of the country. Further, the new Georgian leadership under Saakashvili has demonstrated a willingness to engage in brinkmanship to re-unite the fragmented country, and this poses a serious risk for renewed violence. The central government has little to no influence over Abkhazia: the Abkhaz vote in their own regional elections, raise their own armies, and pay taxes to Sukhum(i) (the regional capital), not to Tbilisi (Georgia's capital). The Abkhaz demand recognition of their de facto independence, which is something that the Georgian leadership is adamant it will not cede.  Although negotiations continue haphazardly, and while there is substantial external pressure on both sides to reach a settlement, Georgia's democracy remains unstable and the Abkhaz have not participated in Georgian politics for more than a decade. Levels of violence for most years post-2000 have been low, with relative peace maintained by a UN observer mission (UNOMIG). However, in 2008, renewed violence, involving land, air and sea warfare, directly involved Russian troops in a five-day conflict with Georgian troops on one side and Russian, Ossetian and Abkhazian troops on the other. While a peace agreement was mediated, tensions remain high on all sides."
75007,"The Kashmiri Muslims have four of the factors that increase the likelihood of continued rebellion in the future: a decade-long high-level insurgency; territorial concentration; generally high levels of group organization; and recurring government repression. Factors that might inhibit or limit future rebellion include India's tradition of democratic rule; its past ability to negotiate settlements with separatist groups; and transnational efforts in support of a diplomatic settlement. More than 65,000 people have died since the Kashmir insurgency began in late 1989. Efforts to reach a negotiated settlement will require the active involvement of the Indian government, Pakistan, and Kashmiri rebel groups, who have so far largely been excluded from any talks."
75012,"The Sikhs have two of the factors that increase the likelihood of rebellion in the future: persistent protest in the past and territorial concentration. Factors that inhibit the resurgence of the rebellion include India's stable democratic tradition and its past efforts to reach settlements that provide greater autonomy. The restoration of the political process in the Punjab, through the holding of state elections in 1997, has also facilitated a return to normalcy. The population is weary of war and the focus is on rebuilding the state's economic base. Finally, with Singh as Prime Minister, it is unlikely that large divisions will occur between the Sikhs and other Indians because he demonstrates a major unification amongst all Indians, regardless of religion."
85005,"There have been massive protests and sporadic rebellion among West Papuans since 1999. Several factors suggest the likelihood of the continuation of rebellion: territorial concentration; high degree of group cohesion and organization; Indonesian's unstable regime; and Jakartas ongoing repression. A number of West Papuans remain committed to independence and are likely to continue rebellion, although at relatively low levels.  Jakarta began implementation of a Special Autonomy Law in 2001. While the law addressed many of Papuans grievances, the Indonesian military has resisted full implementation and continues to perpetrate human rights abuses in the province. As a consequence, Papuans claimed that a Special Autonomy Law was a total failure, demanding the government to review. In 2005, at least 10,000 Papuans protested against the 2001 Special Autonomy Law. "
70501,"Russians in Kazakhstan exhibit a low to moderate risk of violent rebellion in the near future. Russians are territorially concentrated in the northern region of Kazakhstan and show high levels of group cohesion. Protest, while present since Kazakh independence, peaked in the mid-1990s and has remained relatively low ever since. However, it should be noted that these low levels of protest occured within an authoritarian regime, which often restricts high-level protests. Resentment does linger over the loss in status Russians have experienced since Kazakh independence. Russian protest is likely to persist, at least at low levels, in Kazakhstan. Discrimination against Russians in senior government positions plus arrests of prominent Russian activists and Russian journalists, and tight control over Russian language newspapers, radio and television programs provide grievances to sustain such protests. Furthermore there is no evidence to show that Kazakhstan's willingness to eliminate some forms of discrimination against Russians is done for any reason other than to appease Russia. Nevertheless, these protests are unlikely to increase barring any significant changes to the current state of affairs. The large exodus of ethnic Russians that occurred during the 1990s has slowed of late, reflecting, in part, the new economic opportunities within Kazakhstan's oil and gas boom; to a lesser degree, it reflects increased difficulties acquiring Russian citizenship."
81201,"The Hmong have four of the factors that increase the chances of future rebellion: current low-level insurgency; territorial concentration; recent government repression; and a history of lost autonomy. They also have two of the factors that lead to an increased risk of protest: government repression and support from kindred abroad. Improving the group's economic status along with allowing the Hmong to practice their religious and cultural beliefs could decrease the prospects of future violence. However, so long as the government continues to use indiscriminate repression and forced relocations, violence is likely to continue, at least at low levels."
35902,"Slavs in Moldova (primarily Russians and Ukrainians) are politically and geographically divided between the separatist Transdniestr region on the one hand, and major cities within the rest of Moldova on the other. The numeric majority, which live outside the separatist region, show little risk of rebellion as they do not suffer from government repression, face little to no discrimination and are not regionally concentrated. For the group within the separatist region, risks remain: the Slavs are a concentrated majority and dominate the authoritarian political system; the Transdniestr authorities have their own armed forces and access to weapons; and the group receives financial and military support from an outside patron (Russia). Nevertheless, there are strong factors that mitigate against renewed violence: Moldovan authorities have demonstrated a commitment to the diplomatic process for conflict resolution; Russia's armed forces in Transdniestria serve as a guarantor of the current status quo, which Moldova is almost certain not to antagonize; and there has been no serious violence since the brief civil war in 1992. Further, the international community (OSCE, EU, Russia, US) has increased its attention on Moldova's ""frozen conflict"", especially since Romania's accession to the EU in 2007 placed Moldova on the EU's border. While each side's position in the dispute appears intractable (Transdniestria demands independence; Moldova will offer only widespread autonomy), several proposals have come close to acceptance by both sides, suggesting that a negotiated solution is ultimately both possible and more likely than violence."
77507,"The Shan have four of the five factors that increase the chances of future rebellion: current rebellion; territorial concentration; high levels of support for group organizations; and widespread repression by state authorities. Since the late 1980s, the military junta has negotiated ceasefire agreements with 15 ethnic groups including the Shan State Army. At least two Shan rebel groups remain militarily active. However, given the major counterinsurgency campaign that has been underway in Shan state for the past several years, they have been limited in their ability to undertake militant actions."
56504,"The Caprivians have several of the factors that increase the likelihood of future rebellion: territorial concentration; recent government repression; and lack of support by the government or transnational groups for reform. However, there are other factors that favor the containment of rebellion: Namibia is a stable democracy; the group is not very well organized or mobilized; and past protest and rebellion has been fairly limited. Although the group does not encounter significant political or cultural restrictions often associated with protest, repression against the group might contribute to future group protest."
47503,"The Ibo (Igbo) face a few of the factors that might encourage protest. The group has a history of persistent protest, political and cultural restrictions, and Nigeria is a new democracy. Recent repression, group cohesion and recent rebellion are some of the factors that will continue to place the group at risk for future rebellion. Additionally, the Ibo face harassment and occasional violence from the Muslim Hausa/Fulani, and the Ibo have retaliated with violence. If the Ibo and other ethnic groups continue to perceive themselves as marginalized, they will continue to fight the state and one another for greater political power."
47505,"The Yoruba are at a low risk for future rebellion. Even though they do have a history of protest, they have only engaged in militant activities once against the Nigerian government in the past. At present, the group does not face any significant political, economic or social discrimination. In fact, the Yoruba won the presidency in the 2003 elections. There is, however, some risk of renewed protest, since the Nigerian government continues to adopt repressive tactics. In addition, there are reports of communal violence between the Yoruba and the plurality Hausa-Fulani communities. If not managed, these factors could contribute to increasing discontent, and perhaps even violence."
77006,"Sindhis are unlikely to take their political opposition to the level of rebellion, although radical organizations like the Jeay Sindh and the Sindh National Party have been accused of low levels of violence in the past. However, Sindhi protest is more likely, although the return of Sindhi-led civilian rule mitigates that risk significantly.. While inter-ethnic violence in the Sindh province has been a real problem in the past, intercommunal cooperation has grown since 2000, with fragile coalitions forming between Sindhis and Mohajirs, Baluchis and Pashtuns. With these ethnic groups banding together in protest against the Musharraf government, the risk for intercommunal violence is fairly low. However, it is still too soon to tell if these cross-ethnic alliances will endure with the return to civilian rule. Political stability in Sindh will depend on the continuance and growth of this alliance. The strengthening of this alliance could also facilitate meeting the sometimes desperate resource needs of both indigenous and immigrant populations in Sindh."
91001,"The past few years have brought about substantial changes for the Bougainvilleans in Papua New Guinea (PNG). In 2001, a peace agreement was signed between rebels and the government, establishing regional autonomy for Bougainville. Since that time, there has been a virtual cessation of fighting and violence; a program to surrender weapons has been completed under a UN mandate; internally displaced refugees have returned to their homes; and, at the end of 2004, a final draft constitution was agreed upon by the PNG parliament. In 2005, elections for the first Autonomous Bougainville Government took place, with Joseph Kabui and the Bougainville People's Congress winning. Nevertheless, more than 20,000 people have died since the outbreak of the rebellion in December of 1988 and, with factors such as persistent past protest and rebellion; territorial concentration; and high levels of group cohesion, the chance of future rebellion remains. Further, although Francis Ona, founder of the Bougainville Revolutionary Army and head of the militant Mekamui faction of that group passed away in 2005, he has been succeeded by Noah Musingku, and the Mekamui faction continues to be active."
36533,"Buryats show little risk for rebellion in the near future, despite territorial concentration and a strong group identity. There has been no rebellion in the post-Soviet era, and Buryat protest has generally been low, despite several incidents that could have mobilized the population. Most recently (2005-2006), Russia's central government caused some opposition by amalgamating Buryat regions with regions containing large, non-Buryat populations.  This resulted only in modest protest, perhaps because Buryat regions already contain large, non-Buryat populations."
43301,"The Diolas of the Casamance region of Senegal have several risk factors for rebellion, including current and historical rebellion, territorial concentration and moderate government repression. However, other factors mitigate the risk that rebellion will become large-scale, including efforts at negotiation and reform and transnational support for negotiations and reform. Radical wings of the Movement of Democratic Forces in Casamancais (MDFC) are likely to continue low-scale violence in the near future, as the government of Senegal remains unable and unwilling to meet their minimum demands of widespread autonomy for the Casamance region. Furthermore, due in large part to the porosity of the Senegal-Gambia and Senegal-Guinea Bissau borders, the government is unable to eradicate rebel capacity to strike. There is also a significant risk of protest for the Diolas, although due to the rural residence of most Diolas, protests are unlikely to be sustained or large. However, the unconsolidated nature of Senegal's democracy in combination with continued marginalization of Diolas in both the political and economic sphere make low-level protests likely."
62503,"Although a ceasefire held from 2002 until the signing of a final peace agreement in 2004, the future of the Nuba remains uncertain. Unlike the provinces of Southern Sudan, the Nuba mountain region will not have the option of self-determination and will be viewed as an integral part of northern Sudan. The Nuba occupy a precarious position as a buffer zone between North and South Sudan. While politically aligned with Southern Sudanese, they are geographically located in an area considered part of Northern Sudan. The agreement with the South has considerably weakened the position of the Nuba. Although high intensity rebellion is unlikely in the near future, the Nuba do still exhibit several risk indicators for rebellion, including a high level of territorial concentration, strong group cohesion and a relatively high level of group organization. It is still too early to determine if the Nuba will be effectively integrated politically under the final peace agreement and if they will be allowed to maintain their cultural identity, a primary concern of the group."
51001,"The situation in Zanzibar is difficult to assess. In June 1999, the opposition CUF and the ruling CCM signed an agreement to end their political conflict. The agreement provides for more autonomy for the island, the inclusion of the opposition in the ruling cabinet and an overhaul of the judiciary. The opposition CUF agreed, in turn, to recognize the CCM government and return to parliament. Zanzibar was to gain greater autonomy in exchange for recognizing and cooperating with the CCM government. Despite these agreements, an adequate level of trust between the CUF and CCM does not exist, and the fact that the election of 2000 was boycotted and rigged is evidence of this.  The government repression that resulted after the elections further puts Zanzibaris at risk.  Due to the geographic concentration of the group, a history of recent protests and continual government-inflicted political discrimination and repression, the potential exists for future militant activity and conventional protests. However, the situation in Zanzibar has gained international attention, and the pressure that is being put on the Tanzanian government by the Commonwealth and the European Union may be enough for a future settlement to be effectively put into place. Once again, it will depend on the level of trust that can be created between the CUF and CCM, and this trust may not develop until the current Zanzibar leader is replaced by a more willing negotiator. These problems are now affecting Tanzania as a whole, and they must become a more important issue for the government. Another concern for the Tanzanian government is growing fundamentalism on the Islands of Tanzania, because Tanzania is not willing to allow the islanders to rule themselves according to Islamic law, nor is it willing to give up the islands altogether if that demand should one day be developed by the fundamentalists."
36904,"Crimean Tatars exhibit four of the five factors that encourage rebellion: persistent protest; territorial concentration; high levels of group organization and cohesion; and recent regime instability during the Orange Revolution of November 2004 - January 2005. Crimean Tatar protest will likely remain at fairly high levels because key political and economic grievances are not being addressed by the regional or central government. While most returnees from Central Asia have now received citizenship, contention remains concerning issues such as provision of land, housing, and jobs. The political contest between Crimean Russians and Crimean Tatars over who controls the governance of the peninsula is also likely to continue through the coming years. The highest risk for violence in Crimea is between ethnic Russian and Tatar groups. Limited incidents of violence between these groups have occurred sporadically in recent years. With the increase of the Tatar population, these incidences are likely to increase, barring more vigorous intervention by the central government or other actors."
20003,"Although violence may recur in Northern Ireland, several recent events are hopeful. The Catholics have several of the risk factors that sustain rebellion, including high levels of group concentration and organization, experience of repression, and a long and active heritage of violent opposition to Protestant domination and British rule. However, the Good Friday Accords, although at times implementation has floundered, do attempt to redress Irish Catholic grievances. Furthermore, the IRA began decommissioning weapons in October 2001. IRA disarmament was certified as complete by an international panel in 2005, although some more militant factions may have maintained arms. Protests are likely to continue in the near future, although the magnitude of protests has declined. Major problems remain unresolved, and with the Protestant Orange Order intent on continuing their traditional marches through Catholic neighborhoods each July, there will be provocations for protest for the foreseeable future. The keys to the conflict may no longer lie with the main signatories to the agreement. Those responsible for the riots at the Protestant Orange Order marches, for example, are rarely members of the Order itself, but are rather unaffiliated youths who come looking for trouble. Likewise, many of the attacks blamed on the IRA have in fact been the work of individuals, rival Catholic factions, or even Protestants trying to increase tensions. Thus, even while political leaders on both sides make conciliatory gestures and move away from hard-line views, their attitudes do not always mirror the groups they are supposed to represent. Another important long-term factor is demographics. Northern Ireland's Catholic population is growing at a faster rate than that of the Protestants. Thus, the Catholics will eventually outnumber the Protestants and will be able to use the ballot to achieve their objectives. This alone will be a powerful consideration during the creation of the new government, and may impel Protestants to reach some kind of agreement soon, before they lose their numerical superiority."
204,"Despite their many claims and grievances, there is little chance that the Native Hawaiians will become involved in any rebellious activity in the near future. The Hawaiian separatist movement is gaining strength however, and the potential for increased levels of protest is real. Indigenous rights are an international concern, and while the Hawaiians are not immediately associated with an indigenous movement, their case is as strong as any recognized Native group in the United States. This potential for protest could occur even without the usual risk factors being present, such as cultural or political restrictions, government repression, support from other groups, etc. The issue of sovereignty is now recognized as an important political issue and is addressed by Hawaiian politicians at all levels of local, state and federal government. The creation of new sovereignty based associations in the late 1990s is an illustration of the legitimacy of the issue. Prolonged deliberations into the potential form of Hawaiian sovereignty have temporarily removed the issue from public debate, but may take prominence once the current discussions are made public. Furthermore, questions of Hawaiian heritage - such as the preservation of Native Hawaiian sacred objects and entitlements- have come to play a more important role, and their destruction has increased tensions between white settlers and natives in Hawaii."
34504,"Since the ouster of Milosevic in 2000 the state of Serbia has gone through a drastic overhaul. Under Milosevic, Vojvodina's autonomous status was revoked and protest was prohibited. In 2002, however, this autonomy was largely restored. Hungarians in Serbia live in Vojvodina almost exclusively and constitute a majority of the population in eight continuous municipalities in the north of the country bordering Hungary. While there is some disagreement about the level of autonomy for which they should fight, they are generally well organized and cohesive.  There was no record of government repression of Hungarians during recent years.   The regime in Serbia and Montenegro throughout 2004-2006 was democratic, though as a country emerging from socialism and Milosevics brutal rule, it continued to reform its systems. The government has been in dialog with Hungarian leadership about issues impacting them, especially during the rise in ethnic tensions and low level violence that accompanied it in 2004, but many question the commitment of either the central government or the Serbian government to address the concerns of ethnic Hungarians. Nevertheless, there were no serious armed conflicts in the region during 2004-2006.  Hungarians in Serbia experience no practical political or cultural restrictions. However, Serbia is still a young democracy. While Serbia does not currently represses its Hungarian minority, from 1989-2000, the Hungarian community was repressed by the Milosevic regime. The Hungarian diasporas relationship with Hungary is somewhat complicated, especially after its accession to the EU in 2004. The Hungarian government has advocated for the protection of the rights of their kin in Serbia; however, it is reluctant to become entangled in Serbias domestic affairs."
55203,"Several factors known to increase the likelihood of rebellion are present in the Ndebele case. There is cause for rebellion in terms of recent government repression and a history of past protest to build upon. Of note, there is also a strong basis from which to organize a rebellion. The Ndebele are territorially concentrated and have a strong group identity. In addition, there are organizations already in place to mobilize support. The fact that the regime is undemocratic and uninterested in improving the situation makes accommodation unlikely. While there is no transnational pressure for accommodation, there is violence in neighboring states that makes rebellion seem like a reasonable option for the Ndebele."
70004,"The political situation of Uzbeks in Afghanistan changed radically in 2001, when the United States led a coalition in overthrowing the Pashtun-dominated Taliban government. Although led by a Pashtun, Hamid Karzai, the interim government set in place by 2002 also included ethnic Uzbeks, including General Abdul Rashid Dostum. While they exhibit four of the five factors that encourage rebellion ' past rebellion and current protest; territorial concentration; generally high levels of group organization; and regime instability  Uzbeks are unlikely to rebel against the new central state so long as they maintain representation."
70003,"The political situation of the Tajiks changed radically in 2001, when the United States led a coalition in overthrowing the Pashtun-dominated Taliban government. Although led by a Pashtun, Hamid Karzai, the interim government set in place by 2002 was dominated by ethnic Tajiks. Tajiks are unlikely to rebel against the central state so long as they maintain representation. However, Tajiks continue to be involved in intercommunal conflict, primarily with Pashtuns, Uzbeks, and Hazaras. Until the central government is strong enough to contain warlordism, such clashes are likely to continue. Tajiks have engaged in moderate levels of protest, a situation that is unlikely to change. However, Tajik energy seems mostly directed at conventional electoral mobilization."
54003,"The people of Cabinda have three of the conditions that encourage rebellion: a recent history of insurgency, territorial concentration, and continuing government repression. Factors inhibiting conflict are efforts at negotiations that successfully established the Amnesty Law in August 2006 to stop the violence, transnational support for the 2006 peace agreement, and the 2002 ceasefire in the civil war that had been raging in the rest of Angola. The peace established in 2006 may continue if the government honors the promises outlined in the Amnesty Law. Although some separatists not amenable to the agreement were responsible for scattered violence after the accords were signed, the rebels had, for the most part, desisted and the fragile peace was still in place by the end of 2006. As long as the peace plan continues to move forward, the conflict will most likely not escalate into outright rebellion again.  Despite the progress, restrictions and repression against the group continue. Nonviolent protest activity will likely continue as Cabindans press for their economic and political rights."
37302,"Although many feared that Lezgin demands for the creation of an independent ""Lezgistan"" would result in another secessionist war in Azerbaijan, these fears have thus far proved to be unwarranted. It currently appears less likely than ever that the Lezgins will resort to any sustained collective action to address their grievances, although isolated incidents do occur. In the past 10 years, they have not engaged in any serious protests and only three incidents of violence; they have also shown a willingness to negotiate and compromise on their most intractable demands. The Lezgin nationalist movements do not receive wide support among the Lezgin people who are not well-organized at the grass-roots level. Three other factors suggest that serious Azeri-Lezgin conflict is not likely. First, the Lezgins are well-integrated into Azeri society, and mixed marriages are common. Second, both groups share an Islamic identity, even if the Lezgins are Sunni and the Azeri predominantly Shi'i. It is interesting to note that none of the many ethnic clashes of the Caucasus have pitted Muslim against Muslim. And finally, the Lezgins are not territorially concentrated like the Armenians in Nagorno-Karabakh, which would make secession logistically difficult. The wars in Chechnya and Nagorno Karabakh have had a contradictory effect on the Lezgins. On the one hand, the wars exacerbated the main Lezgin grievances: the division of the Lezgin people and homeland along the Samur river (between Russia and Azerbaijan), and the Azeri draft. However, the ferocity of the fighting seems to have discouraged militant Lezgins by convincing them (and many other Caucasian groups) that Moscow and Baku are determined to maintain a firm hold on their territories. The Lezgins seem to have concluded that the successful route to change is a peaceful one. Of course the Lezgin grievances could be largely satisfied if the Russian government relaxes the tight border controls on the Samur. Such a far-sighted policy shift could perhaps be taken when and if the conflict in Chechnya dies down. The Lezgins in Azerbaijan seem to understand that their interests are best served by integration into Azeri society, not militant defiance. In the last few years even the most ardent Lezgin nationalists have softened their demands. This recognition that their interest lies in peaceful social change bodes well for the prospects for stability in the region."
34601,"Serbs in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) have a low risk of rebellion, while the possibility of protests remains moderate. Serb protests tend to be relatively small and peaceful in nature. Prior to the conflict in the 1990s, Serbs were rather dispersed throughout BiH, having concentrations in the west, northwest and south. As there has been no census since 1991, exact numbers are not available, but Serbs are now primarily dominant in the Republika Srpka (RS). The Serbs have a significant degree of group cohesion and have several political parties. There remains a relatively strong secessionist element among Bosnian Serbs, some of whom are more open and vocal about their desire than others. Despite their occasional bellicose language, these dissenters undertook no violent activities to achieve this goal between 2004 and 2006. Under the 1995 General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina ('Dayton Accords), the Serbs have one member of the state three-part presidency and five members (1/3) in the House of Peoples at the state level. The Dayton Accords also set up two entities, the Republika Srpska (RS) and the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Federation), as well as the Brcko District. The RS has a majority Serb population and roughly approximates the control of territory the Serbs had at the end of the war in 1995. Serbs living in the Federation face discrimination and sporadic violence. The Federation is composed mainly of Bosniaks and Croats. In areas of Serb control, there are instances of conflict between Serbs and Croats and Serbs and Bosniaks. Negotiations on police reform to have a more uniform law enforcement system throughout the country failed between 2004 and 2006. The RS is reluctant to give up any of its autonomy. This means that the two entities have separate police forces. While the RS is in charge of its own police force, several incidents of repression were reported against Serbs in the RS 2004-2006.  While elections are free and fair, full democracy is still a work in progress in BiH. The High Representative of the international community in BiH still holds the so-called Bonn Powers that allow him to intervene at any level of BiH government to assist in the full implementation of the Dayton Accords, which means everything from the removing obstructionist politicians to imposing laws. Additionally, foreign peacekeepers remain in BiH. In 2004, NATOs SFOR officially turned over its mission in BiH to the European Unions EUFOR, which has approximately 7,000 troops on the ground. While there have been no serious armed conflicts in the region since 1999, the Serbs are watching what happens in Kosovo and may try and manipulate the situation with regard to the status of the RS. Violent rebellion is unlikely in for the Serbs in BiH in the near future, however, they may leverage the political situation to their advantage if Kosovo becomes independent.  There are no official political and cultural restrictions against Serbs, however, in areas in which they are a minority, some have reported informal restrictions on their ability to worship as they like. The government in BiH is still not stable on its own without the support and oversight of the international community. There are significant attempts to alter the Constitution established under the Dayton Accords, but there is little agreement on how it should be changed. The current constitutional arrangement is cumbersome, expensive and not workable in the long-term. The standard Serb position on the Constitution is that it should remain intact as is. While Serbs are slightly underrepresented proportionally at the state-level, they control one of the two main entities and have significant autonomy within that territory. Serbia supports the Bosnian Serbs rights and forms special agreements and bilateral ties with the RS, but all but the radicals stop short of calling for reunification."
14002,"Indigenous peoples of Brazil are at moderate risk for rebellion against the state. The following factors are present that encourage rebellion: persistent protest in the past and territorial concentration. However, factors making rebellion less likely, such as efforts at negotiation and land reform within Brazil and a lack of serious armed conflict in neighboring countries, are also present. The likelihood of indigenous participating in protests is higher, as many of the risk factors for protest are present, including: significant political restrictions and support from other indigenous groups in the Americas.  Indigenous peoples of Brazil are more at risk for conflict with other groups in society than they are at risk for direct conflict with the state. Highly dependent on the land and environment of the Amazon for their way of life, culture, and traditions, they live in mineral-rich areas that are being developed by non-indigenous people for gold mining, timber production, oil production, and agriculture. Violent conflict has been increasing since the mid to late-1980s and it appears that it will persist due to the lack of enforcement of laws that would prohibit movement into (or development within) indigenous reserves."
15501,"The indigenous people of Chile are the poorest sector of society and continue to lose land due to privatization and land invasions by settlers. The most-organized group is the Mapuche, which includes the Pehuenche and the Huilliche, and they show no sign of slowing down their opposition to the government. The Mapuches have a history of conflict with the dominant group and continue to protest government policies, sometimes violently. The Mapuche are divided among regions and various organizations, though they have united on issues such as cultural and ethnic recognition. The main source of internal conflict is a lack of agreement on the means to achieve their goals. The most militant group, the All Lands Council, is likely to continue land takeovers, as they have demanded complete autonomy for Mapuche peoples. Other Mapuche groups do not call for autonomy, but rather formal recognition of their language, traditions, and cultures, including bilingual education. It is likely that the less militant groups will continue to voice their demands through electoral processes or non-violent marches and demonstrations. If a full-blown guerrilla group were to emerge in the future, it is likely that militant Mapuche members would participate in it against the government. Though the Chilean government has granted land to the Mapuches during the 1990s, it is unlikely that their poverty and low employment levels will change significantly in the near future, due to their isolation and agrarian lifestyle."
34401,"In 1999, President Tudjman, the nationalist leader of Croatia, died and was replaced by a democratically elected government led by what had been the opposition party. Croatia is proceeding towards European Union membership and therefore must be very careful with how it treats its minority groups. The situation of Serbs has been improving, as evidenced by the influx of Serb refugees back to their homes in Croatia, and this trend is likely to continue.  Nevertheless, serious challenges remain and, unfortunately, the long history of animosity between Serbs and Croats in Croatia and the low number of Serbs in the country mean that few political parties openly cater to the Serb community. The level of political and economic exclusion is high enough for the Serbs to continue to protest their treatment in Croatia, though it appears that the days of militant activity may be over, especially as Croatian Serbs currently lack military support from Serbia. Since the end of the Tudjman era, tensions have been reduced but significant problems remain.  The two pressing issues are (i) high levels of official and societal discrimination against Serbs and (ii) the indeterminate position of hundreds of thousands of Serb refugees (some of whom have returned) who have not had their property restored or been compensated for their losses.  New laws continue to be introduced to combat discrimination, demonstrating an effort on the part of authorities, but it will take time to assess their implementation and efficacy.  Recent court decisions also suggest progress on property restoration and allocation of reconstruction funds to Serbs but, again, these are small advances relative to the size of the challenge."
53004,"The Oromo in Ethiopia exhibit four factors thought to encourage future rebellion: persistent protest and current rebellion; territorial concentration; generally high levels of group organization; and recurring government repression. Until a truly open political system is allowed in Ethiopia, the future condition of the Oromo remains questionable. With the continued insurgency in the south, even Oromo unaffiliated with militant and violent organizations are still targeted and subject to governmental abuse and detention. Further complicating a viable projection of Oromo participation in Ethiopian politics are the disparate claims that various Oromian groups hold, ranging from full political independence to greater regional autonomy to greater participation at the central state level. When and if rebellious activities conclude will likely indicate whether the Oromo can carve out a political niche adequate to their many distinct members. The fact that the Ethiopian regime has completed preparations to annul the official use of Oromo language in over 375 cities and towns of Oromia is one of the many indicators of the level of repression the Oromo people face."
37202,"The situation of the Adzharians exhibit only some of the factors that suggest a risk of violent conflict, such as their high group concentration, and the willingness of Georgia's central government under Saakashvili to use brinkmanship for its domestic policy agenda.  However, since a near violent conflagration in 2004, when Adzharia's long-term leader, Aslan Abashidze, was removed from power, the prospects for peace appear much more enduring.  Abashidze exhibited a highly independent and authoritarian leadership style with military capabilities and a foreign (Russia) supporter that maintained a military base near the capital, Batumi.  Since his departure, a new regional parliament has been elected; military groups have been brought under central state control; and Russia has agreed to close its military base.  Further, no demonstrations or violent activity has been exhibited since the end of 2004. Georgia's central government was elected, in part, on a commitment to reunite the country.   While Adzharia appears to have overcome its most significant hurdle in that process, it is unclear how events in the other two separatist regions could affect relations between Adzhars and Tbilisi in the future.  Nevertheless, Adzharia has defied repeated predictions of violence in the past, and this bodes well for the Adzhars."
37203,"The Ossetian conflict in Georgia exhibits many factors that increase the likelihood of violent conflict in the future: the group has experienced both repression and rebellion in recent past; it is highly organized militarily and politically; there are transnational kin in Russia with whom many Ossetians would like to unite; the group is geographically concentrated in the de facto independent South Ossetian region; and the Georgian government has stated its intention to reunite the country while demonstrating a willingness to engage in violent brinkmanship to achieve that goal, most recently in 2004. Recent negotiations between Tblisi and Tskhinvali, the capital of South Ossetia, have not been fruitful in settling the status of South Ossetia. The Ossetians continue to insist on independence for their state, most recently in a 2006 referendum, although political elites have also called for unification with North Ossetia inside Russia. The Ossetians have a functioning government, with a president and parliament, which were elected over strong Georgian opposition. Tbilisi's policy towards its breakaway republics has been to advocate a unified Georgian state, but with widespread constitutional autonomy, a solution repeatedly rejected by Tskhnavli. While Georgia and South Ossetia have managed to reach agreements on economic reconstruction and the return of some refugees, a political settlement to the conflict has proved elusive. Most of the good-will that had built-up between the two sides of the conflict over the past ten years was seriously damaged with the large-scale fighting that occurred in 2004 between government forces and South Ossetian military units. No major violent incidents occurred in 2005 and 2006, but low-level violence occasionally continued and tensions remain high. However, in 2008, renewed violence, involving land, air and sea warfare, directly involved Russian troops in a five-day conflict with Georgian troops on one side and Russian, Ossetian and Abkhazian troops on the other. While a peace agreement was mediated, tensions remain high on all sides."
75013,"The Mizos in India have three of the factors that increase the chances of future rebellion: territorial concentration; a high level of group support for organizations representing their interests; and a history of lost autonomy. Factors that could inhibit future rebellion include: India's history as a stable democracy; persistent federal government efforts to negotiate settlements with groups seeking autonomy; and the lack of transnational support for the Mizos despite ongoing armed conflicts in neighboring countries like Burma. It appears that Mizo desires for self-determination were largely satisfied with the creation of a separate state of Mizoram in 1986. Mizoram remains one of the few states in India's northeast that has remained relatively free of violence in the past 15 years. The major issue confronting its residents is the relationship between the Mizos and the Reangs (also called Bru) and whether Reang desires for greater autonomy can be incorporated within Mizoram without the occurrence of further violence. The Bru National Liberation Front has been at odds with the offical government of Mizoram since 1996 and has a primary objective as the protection of rights and dignity of Bru (Reangs). It has also demanded a separate Reang homeland in Mizoram. Subsequently, it transformed its stand and aimed to achieve a separate Autonomous District Council (ADC), and reservation in the Mizoram Legislative Assembly for the community. Only recently, it has agreed to tone down its demand for an ADC and settle for a regional council."
75014,The Tripuras exhibit several factors that increase the likelihood of continuing rebellion: current rebellion; territorial concentration; repression by state authorities; a history of lost autonomy; and generally high levels of group organization. Factors that could inhibit rebellion include India's history of democratic government and its tradition of attempting to reach settlements with groups seeking autonomy or independence.
63007,"Kurds have most of the risk factors for rebellion, including: current rebellion; territorial concentration; high levels of group organization; government repression; and a history of lost autonomy. Although several Kurdish organizations have moved away from violence, low-level rebellion is likely to continue in the near future. With the election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2005 the situation of Kurdish Iranians went from bad to worse. After broken promises by Mohammad Khatami's more moderate presidency from 1997 to 2005, the Kurdish situation, along with other ethnic minorities, has only worsened. The condition of Kurdish Iranians is more precarious than the Bakhtiari (because of their higher numbers and Sunni Muslim faith) or the Baluchis (because of their advocacy of autonomy and intellectual urban bases)."
70302,"There is a moderate risk of rebellion by ethnic Uzbeks in Kyrgyzstan in the near future. Ethnic Uzbeks exhibit five of the characteristics that increase the risk of violence: persistent protest; territorial concentration; generally high levels of group cohesion and organization; recent regime instability; and social discrimination and government repression. Ethnic Uzbeks demonstrated a willingness to protest and rebel in the early 1990s and, after a lull in the late 1990s, have recently increased their levels of protest. The explicitly non-violent Islamic Hizb ut-Tahrir advocates the establishment of a Caliphate in Central Asia and has exposed ethnic Uzbeks to increased state repression, but it also may undermine the likelihood of violent actions by the minority. Protest by ethnic Uzbeks will likely continue at low to moderate levels in the near future. The Akayev government did little to address Uzbek grievances, which only aggravated tensions. It was southern cities, such as Osh (where Uzbeks are concentrated), that saw the first violent revolt, which ousted the president in 2005. It remains to be seen what policies the new government will pursue, but if Uzbeks are not able to go through formal or electoral channels to express grievances, popular protest can be expected to increase."
34301,"While there has been political violence in the past five years and peaceful protests continue, there is little risk of future rebellion by the Albanians in Macedonia. While 2001 brought ethnic tensions to a climax as a violent insurgency caused more than 170,000 ethnic Albanians and Macedonians to flee their homes, the Ohrid Framework Agreement provided a platform for accommodation of Albanian demands.  Some interethnic tension occasionally erupts, but more prominent during 2004-2006 was intraethnic tension especially among competing Albanian political parties.  The Framework Agreement may mitigate the other risk factors the group has for rebellion such as recent rebellion, recent repression, territorial concentration and group cohesion.  Although, the regime in Macedonia is a transitioning democracy, it has largely escaped the devastating violence that ravaged most of the rest of the former Yugoslavia.  During the period from 2004-2006, the entire region was free of wide-scale violent conflict. The 2001 Macedonia violence was short-lived and ended in the Ohrid Framework Agreement, which allowed for a broad range of minority rights legislation to be enacted.   The risk of protests is higher than the risk of rebellion. While most discrimination against Albanians in Macedonia is informal, Albanians do have grievances.  Other risks include the persistence and recent history of some government repression.  Albanians in Macedonia receive rhetorical support from their kindred in Kosovo and Albania, though there was no evidence of other modes of support from these populations."
60003,"Saharawis enjoy high levels of territorial concentration and group organization and cohesion. As of late, these factors have fostered few instances of rebellion. The violence of May 2005 is the one major exception. However, protest continues to be a large part of daily life. While the ceasefire has held with only minor skirmishes marring it over the past decade, the continued delay of the referendum increases the likelihood that widespread violence will break out again. Factors inhibiting the intensification of the conflict include transnational support for settlement, including international pressure to conduct the referendum and honor its outcome. The Moroccans seem unwilling to allow a referendum unless they can stack the deck in their favor (by including resettled Moroccans on the voter rolls) and the Polisario Front opposes this. Also, the Moroccan government continues to act periodically in bad faith by repressing demonstrations, engaging in mass arrests and probably torture, sending warplanes which occasionally open fire over the Western Sahara, illegally moving people across the borders, strengthening its defenses within the region during ceasefires, moving troops into the region, and intimidating the inhabitants of the Western Sahara. The death of King Hassan II in July 1999 sparked hope for a final settlement of the dispute. Hassan, who led the so-called Green March of Moroccan citizens into Western Sahara, made the Western Sahara issue a foundational issue of his rule and legitimacy. His son, King Mohammed VI, has not done the same. As his legitimacy, both internally and internationally, is likely to rest more on democratization and economic development, continued delay of the referendum may be seen as harmful. However, Mohammed has maintained that Morocco has a legitimate claim to Western Sahara even while pledging that the referendum will take place. In 2001, UN Special Envoy James Baker III proposed an alternative autonomy plan, known as the 'third option. Although Polisario showed willingness to accept the plan, the Moroccan government again refused to accept. Just two years later, the UN proposed a plan whereby Western Sahara would be autonomous for up to five years, after which the referendum would be voted upon. After Bakers resignation in 2004, Kofi Annan named Dutch diplomat Peter van Walsum as his replacement. As of 2006, the negotiations as to how, when, or if the referendum will occur, remain stalemated.  Should the referendum, when held, decide on independence, Moroccos government may not recognize its legitimacy. If this happens, observers can expect an almost immediate return to violent rebellion by the Polisario Front."
77504,"The Karen have four of the five factors that increase the chances of future rebellion: current rebellion; territorial concentration; recent government repression; and a generally high level of group organization. However, given the major counterinsurgency campaign that has been underway in Karen state in recent years, it is not clear if the Karen National Union can still pose a significant threat. It is likely that the KNU will be reduced to low to moderate-level rebellion along the Thai-Burmese border."
47506,"The Ijaw are risk of both rebellion and protest. The group faces significant political and cultural restrictions as well as repression, which are factors encouraging rebellion. They are at risk of rebellion because of history of protest, some violence, territorial concentration and repression. The government has thus far neglected Ijaw concerns; however efforts at negotiation and reform and absorption of the group into Nigeria's democratization process could alleviate these risks.  The government should focus on balancing the demands of the community with the interests of the oil companies operating in the Delta region. Conflicts between the various ethnic groups in the Niger Delta also reflect the problems that each group has with the federal government."
13503,"Peru's Amazonian indigenous communities are among the country's poorest and most politically marginalized. Though the successful 2000 presidential campaign of Alejandro Toledo drew strength from the candidate's indigenous heritage, lowland groups were a relatively weak presence in the campaign. However, with the apparent success in suppressing Peru's violent revolutionary groups, the possibility of random or targeted violence has dramatically declined. For the near-term, lowland groups are likely to continue to face chronic social and cultural injustices that will continue to place them at risk for future protest, but the likelihood of a violent rebellion from lowland organizations is relatively small."
84002,"The Cordilleras have five of the factors that increase the chances of future rebellion: a history of persistent protest; territorial concentration; high levels of group organization; government repression; and the unstable nature of the Philippine government in the past five years. Factors that could inhibit future rebellion include the country's status as a new democracy coupled with the government's efforts to negotiate settlements with insurgent groups. Another significant factor is how future economic development will be pursued in the Cordillera Administrative Region. Addressing tribal concerns about protecting their lands, culture, and livelihoods will be critical to help ensure peace."
36534,"Although the Kumyk have some of the risk factors associated with ethnonational conflict (high levels of group organization and cohesion, territorial concentration, and demands for political autonomy), there has been no record of persistent protest since 1992. While Moscow has shown a willingness to involve itself in Dagestani politics (the multi-ethnic autonomous republic within Russia where the vast majority of Kumyks are located) in attempts to stem the spread of political violence, this has not prevented some ethnic Kumyks becoming involved in violent conflicts with the state in recent years.  Nevertheless, the level of organization for violent ethno-political ends in 2006 remained virtually non-existent among Kumyks. Until the mid-1990s, the Kumyks were the most active and contentious of the Dagestani groups and most frequently involved in intergroup disputes. This may have been because they were among the most privileged in Dagestan and are from a cultural tradition which is distinct from the Caucasian groups there. They also saw other groups as trespassing on Kumyk lands and threatening the survival of Kumyk culture. The lands they have historically occupied are among the most valuable in Dagestan. Since 1995, however, despite a few violent incidents, the media have reported little Kumyk activity. This may be due to a variety of factors. First, it seems that Kumyks have retained their relatively privileged status in Dagestan.  Second, since the Kumyks live along the border with Chechnya, they observed at close range the results of large-scale violence against central authorities. While Kumyks have not been listed in the leadership of the ""Wahhabi"" movement, it is possible that some of the more militant Kumyks have left traditional Kumyk groups to join the Islamist organization. Kumyks have been listed among the ethnic groups joining the Chechen militia."
31701,"The Hungarians in Slovakia exhibit two factors that encourage rebellion: territorial concentration and generally high levels of group organization and cohesion. Continuing to suffer various types of discrimination, tensions between Hungarians and Slovaks have increased over the last few years. Although Slovak Hungarian parties have been part of the ruling democratic coalition since 1998, there have been increasing attempts by Slovak nationalist parties to limit the power of Hungarians in the central government. Nonetheless, official Slovak nationalism has declined as given evidence by the personalistic splits within the Slovak National Party (SNS) itself, leading to its failure to enter the parliament. In the absence of official discrimination, therefore, Hungarians are unlikely to engage in violence against the state. While far from being eliminated, the risk factors for protest have also declined considerably since the 1998 elections. The passage of the language law and the reinstatement of the various protections given Hungarians and other minorities in education have eliminated some of the most pressing issues for the Hungarian community. In addition, the new government has shown a willingness to conform to the norms of the European Union in exchange for inclusion. Despite these positive changes, however, some issues remain unresolved. Discrimination against Hungarians persists. Much of it is based on the entrenched anti-Hungarian feelings shared by many Slovaks who fear the magyarization of the southern region and possible discrimination in the hands of Hungarians should they gain more autonomy.  Specifically, the Hungarians in Slovakia endure a higher unemployment rate and live in a greater degree of poverty compared to the majority Slovaks in other parts of the country. These issues may linger for many years, providing some potential for future conflicts."
52001,"The condition of the Issaq in Somaliland is generally much better than it was before secession. Yet, the Issaq remain at risk from two fronts. First, occasional fighting by sub-clans could break out into widespread violence, and Egal's death means that his role in neutralizing sub-clan rivalries within Somaliland is gone. Issaq who support reunification with Somalia will remain at odds with those who support continued independence until it is formally recognized internationally. Second, southern clans clearly are against the independence of Somaliland but are currently in no position to take back this territory. If one clan ever achieves complete control over the South, or if a stable peace deal is reached amongst the main clans, its leaders may turn their attention to regaining the North."
56006,"The Zulus face only a very limited risk of future rebellion. The group has a history of protest to seek greater autonomy. South Africa's stable and democratic regime has, however, taken steps to reduce repression against the Zulus and to accommodate the concerns of the group. Factors that could encourage protest are a history of protest and high levels of crime and poverty in the KwaZulu-Natal province. Nonetheless, if the South African government continues to be representative and accommodating it is likely the Zulus will seek redress within the system, rather than opposing it."
62501,"A final peace agreement was signed between the government of Sudan and the SPLM/A in 2005. As part of the agreement, John Garang was named a vice-president of Sudan, SPLM/A forces became part of Sudan's national forces with security responsibilities in Southern Sudan, revenues will be divided equally between the central government and Southern Sudan, and Southern Sudan is guaranteed widespread autonomy with the right to vote for secession after a six-year interim period. The peace agreement survived the death of Garang in a plane crash in 2005. If the peace accords continue to be implemented, the Southern Sudanese are unlikely to rebel, despite the continued presence of risk factors such as territorial concentration and group cohesion. However, the likelihood of rebellion given the failure of the government of Sudan to fully implement or respect the terms of the accord is quite high."
47102,"The condition of Westerners in Cameroon is unclear as the major Anglophone demand is to return to the 1972 federal political structure, thereby obtaining substantial autonomy from the dominant Francophone political culture. In the meantime, Francophones fear that all Anglophones are seeking eventual independence. As a result of the increased oppositional mobilization, Biya has endorsed the concept of decentralization, but has not yet considered a return to a federal structure. However, Biya has conceded the autonomy of Anglophone education and a potential signal for the future may lie in Biya's appointment of an Anglophone as prime minister. Although the Prime Minister is Anglophone, his appointment has done little to address the political discrimination Westerners face in Cameroon. If militants in the opposition can be restrained by continuing political concessions, the likelihood of violent rebellion is probably small despite the fact that Westerners face several risk factors such as recent repression, consistent past protest and discrimination. However, if the conventional SDF and its leader Fru Ndi continue to face repression, this will cause extreme tensions between the Anglophones, who are trying to achieve reform through the system, and the ruling Francophones. In short, Anglophones are continuing to protest until much of their demands are met; Biyas counter-actions will prove whether nonviolent means (combined with threats of secession and rebellion) will be continued in expressing Anglophone grievances, or if more militant means will eventually be sought."
48302,"Southerners in Chad exhibit several characteristics that make likely armed rebellion. First and foremost is the recent history of widespread violence in the mid- to late 1990s and of continued sporadic attacks through late 2001. Connected to this is the large number of militant Southern organizations. However, since 2002, opposition became more politically oriented in place of violence. The concentration of Southerners in one region is another factor facilitating rebellion. Continued human rights violations and restrictions on peaceful protest may also encourage violent responses. The 2001 elections leading to the arrest and torture of the Southerner candidate, Yorongar, and the 2003 naming of the first non-southern Christian to the post of Prime Minister in 25 years further alienated Southerners from the government, thus increasing their risk for future rebellion. Finally, rebellion in the North of the country serves to weaken the central government, providing an opening for Southern rebel groups. However, there are also many factors inhibiting rebellion in the South. While violence is perhaps likely, the Southern lack of coordination and organization makes unlikely the resumption of large-scale military attacks. In fact, deaths from military attacks have consistently dropped since 1998. The change in attitude of CMAP, with its expressing a preference for negotiation in 2001, and Deby's willingness to negotiate, also point to a turn to conventional political activity. The presence of a Southerner candidate in the 2001 elections further illustrates a tendency toward more conventional tactics. Continued opening of the political system also should create incentives for peaceful protest and conventional politics. Another development militating against a resurgence of armed resistance is the governments reaching a peace accord with Northern rebels in spring 2002. The cessation of fighting in the North makes available resources to curb any violence that should appear in the South. Political protest has been historically low in southern Chad, although it reached a peak in the 1980s. Recently, protest has been restricted to verbal protest. However, continued significant political and cultural restrictions combined with governments partial democratization may lead to increased protest in the future. Furthermore, the continuing development of the Chad-Cameroon pipeline and oil exploration in Southern Chad may fuel increased protest if the government does not propose a more favorable distribution of oil revenues."
49005,"At present, the Lunda/Yeke of the DRC's Katanga, or Shaba, region have been negatively affected by the ongoing violence. However, the region exists west of the worst conflict, so the Lunda may be removed from the worst effects of the violence. However, it is difficult to predict the future of the Lunda given the volatile nature of war. For example, what would occur if Angolan troops (largely their patrons) pulled out, or what the lingering consequences of Lunda-Luba hostilities of the early 1990s would mean for a post-war DRC? Recently, the 2006 elections outcome threatened to reignite tensions between the Luba and the Lunda. The last major rupture in relations between these two groups in 1992-1993 led to the death of about 10,000 Luba and the displacement of thousands more. Thus, government repression and a new fledgling democracy following the 2006 elections may further place the group at risk for protest and violence. Although Lunda secessionist demands have been dormant, this is no guarantee that Katangans have forgotten their push for full independence. As such, the Lunda and Yeke must still be considered at risk for rebellion within the DRC due to 1.) territorial concentration, 2.) regime instability and 3.) recent government repression.   Furthermore, resentment over resources may also put the Lunda at risk. The Lunda and Luba inhabit a resource rich locale, and yet sources indicate that the Luba have more access to education and to the exploitation of those resources than their Lunda counterparts."
52201,"Afars in Djibouti have several risk factors for rebellion, including a recent history of rebellion, territorial concentration and government instability. However, sustained efforts at negotiation and reform and transnational support for such efforts mitigate the risks that Afars will return to violence in a sustained manner. The condition of Afars in Djibouti is certainly better at present than a decade ago. However, despite some political reforms, ethnic Issa presently dominate executive decision-making, the civil service, and the ruling party, a situation that has bred resentment and political competition between the Somali Issas and the Afars. Because a certain number of Afar still wish to reunite with their brethren in the region, there is a level of uncertainty concerning the Afar. The signing in May 2001 of an agreement between the Djibouti government and the Afar organization FRUD regarding decentralisation and efforts to ease Afar insurgency in northern and south-western Djibouti temporarily eased tensions. However, the government has not, as of 2006, honored pledges for democratic decentralization, although a number of ethnic Afars serve in the national assembly and on the cabinet. Afars are more likely to engage in protest than armed rebellion in the near future, as the partial democratization of Djibouti has opened up political space and grievances regarding full implementation of the 2001 peace accords have not yet been addressed."
53005,"Somalis in Ethiopia exhibit four factors that encourage rebellion: current rebellion, territorial concentration, high levels of group organization and government repression. As long as anarchy and cross-border insurgencies continue from southern Somalia, it is likely that Somalis in Ethiopia will remain a minority at risk. It is still typical for regional authorities to arrest and detain persons without charge or trial for activities allegedly in support of armed opposition groups and the military campaign against the ONLF persists. Somalis' history of opposition to the Ethiopian state, their social and religious dissimilarity to Tigreans, demographic and economic stress, and the novelty of Ethiopias democratic transition make it difficult to predict a peaceful and stable future for Somalis in Ethiopia. However, the voluntary return of several thousands of Somalis to Somaliland, continuing well into 2004, might ease some of the tensions that refugees endure while living in Ethiopia."
75015,"The Assamese have four of the factors that increase the likelihood of continuing rebellion: current rebellion; territorial concentration; generally high levels of group organization; and repression by state authorities. Factors that could inhibit rebellion include India's stable history of democratic rule, Indian-Bhutanese cooperation to limit cross-border sanctuary for ULFA members, and India's tradition of attempting to reach settlements with groups seeking autonomy or independence."
75009,"The Nagas in India have four of the factors that increase the likelihood of continuing rebellion: current rebellion; territorial concentration; repression by the government; and lost autonomy due to their inclusion in the Indian union in 1947. Factors that could possibly inhibit future militant actions include the Naga populace's desire for an end to violence and the government's promotion of economic development. In addition, India has a tradition of negotiating agreements that provide various separatist groups with some degree of autonomy. In 2000 India was also able to convince Burma to start closing down NSCN bases, further constraining rebel activities.  The most violent conflict currently involving Nagas is the internecine rivalry between the Isak-Muivah and Khaplang factions of the National Socialist Council of Nagaland. A third faction, the NSCN-Unification, was formed in 2007 in an attempt to unify the divided Naga insurgents. However, such efforts were rejected by the NSCN-IM. As such, continuing violence between the Naga rivals is likely to continue."
85006,"Aceh province was hard-struck by the tsunami that hit the region in December 2004 and which killed an estimated 160,000 in the province alone. While conflict continued in the aftermath of the tsunami, in August 2005 a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the government of Indonesia and the Free Aceh Movement (GAM). THE MoU also established the Aceh Monitoring Mission with contributions from the EU and ASEAN. In 2006, GAM disbanded its military wing and formally renounced the use of violence. Concurrently, in August 2006, the Indonesian parliament passed the Law on Governing Aceh (LoGA) in accordance with the autonomy stipulations of the MoU. Provincial elections in December of 2006 permitted local parties to participate and saw the election of a former GAM commander, Irwandi Yusuf, as governor. He was formally installed in February 2007. It remains to be seen if Jakarta will realize its promise of granting full autonomy to Aceh. Economic issues, as well as the presense of Indonesian security personnel in Aceh, are divisive factors of the LoGA that question Jakarta's commitment to Acehnese autonomy. Although the Acehnese possess some factors that encourage rebellion, it is unlikely that rebellion will ensue. The MoU and seminal LoGA legislation is promising for Aceh's autonomy, and its citizens are weary of the violence that wracked the region for almost 30 years. Furthermore, the democratic local elections in December 2006 were a success, and Acehnese parties are now preparing to participate in the national elections in 2009. Even still, unresolved economic issues and Acehnese desire for accountability of past human rights abuses, especially amidst a new democratic climate in the province, make protest a likely tool for Acehnese demands."
64504,"Until the first few months of 2003, the situation of the Kurds in Iraq remained basically unchanged: despite Iraqi government unfriendliness toward the Kurds, their internationally supported autonomous region in the north was largely free of any interference from Saddam Hussein's regime. While the current power-sharing model incorporating Shi'a, Sunnis and Kurds may ultimately lead to a more stable and democratic Iraq if the groups learn to compromise with one another, the future of Iraq is extremely hard to predict right now. Security concerns are real for much of the population, Sunni and Shi'a alike ' indeed, perhaps the Kurds are safest in their northern region where they have been autonomous since the early 1990s. Law and order has broken down and U.S. and Iraqi forces are struggling to quell an insurgency. Most of the violent insurgency is comprised of Sunnis, and the Kurdish military has fought side by side with American forces in ousting Saddam Hussein as well as in suppressing the ensuing rebellion. All Iraqi Kurdish factions supported Hussein's overthrow."
32503,"There is very little chance that the Sardinians will resort to sustained militant political strategies in the near future, as they have only two of the risk factors for rebellion: territorial concentration and a history of lost autonomy. Additionally, the democratic nature of the Italian state and the lack of serious armed conflicts in neighboring countries further reduces the likelihood of rebellion. The occasional references to kidnappings on Sardinia seem to be economically motivated and do not reflect political or ideological demands.  The Sardinians also lack the risk factors usually associated with the potential for protest. They do not face political or cultural restrictions, or government repression. They also do not have any external kindred support. Nonetheless there is still the potential for future protest, due to their distinct history and their concerns for the protection of the Sard language. Additionally, protest activity has occurred, although sporadically, in recent years."
43201,"While the Tuareg are territorially concentrated, a risk factor for rebellion, they exhibit only low levels of political organization and moderate levels of group cohesion with no instances of recent governmental repression, which has significantly lessened post-1990s rebellion. Furthermore, the government has moved to lessen some grievances and the democratic transition has provided more openings for conventional and nonviolent political activity, further lessening incentives for rebellion. Despite a lack of risk factors for rebellion, recent skirmishes with government forces and the government's inability to adequately address the underdevelopment and poverty grievances of the group continue to place the Tuareg at risk for future rebellion., Chances of Tuareg protest are moderate. The partial nature of Mali's democratic transition would encourage protest, as would the Tuaregs' marginalized position politically, economically and culturally. However, probably due to a lack of group organization, protest has not occurred in recent years. Tuareg continue to be at risk for social and economic problems. Tensions with sedentary peoples remain. With the continuation of droughts in the north of Mali, their nomadic existence remains precarious. The Malian economy is growing and multiparty democracy has successfully been implemented within the state, yet the place of the Tuareg in Malian society promises to be difficult to establish. The Tuareg face difficulties over whether to maintain their nomadic lifestyle or to become more integrated into the social fabric of modern life in Mali."
77502,"The Chin, who also refer to themselves as Zomi, have four of the five factors that increase the chances of future rebellion: current rebellion, territorial concentration, high levels of group cohesion, and recent government repression. Although it is likely that there will continue to be low-level resistance, the military junta's success in reaching ceasefire agreements with 15 ethnic groups by the mid-1990s coupled with its suppression of the remaining rebel groups does not bode well for the future status of the Chin."
77505,"The Mon have three of the five factors that increase the chances of future rebellion: territorial concentration; recent repression by state authorities; and a generally high level of group organization. Since the late 1980s, more than 15 ethnic groups, including the Mon, have reached ceasefire deals with the military junta. These agreements generally provide for some local control and promises of economic development, though the junta discontinued provision of economic aid to the New Mon State Party (NMSP) in September 2005. Whether these provisions are resumed and increased will also likely influence the prospects of future rebellion."
9302,"Indigenous in Nicaragua have several risk factors for rebellion, in particular the indigenous Miskitos. They are territorially concentrated, have relatively high levels of group cohesion. However, several factors are also present that inhibit rebellion, including the democratic nature of the Nicaraguan government, efforts at negotiation and reform, and the lack of serious armed conflict in neighboring countries. The status of the Miskito and other indigenous peoples of Nicaragua improved following the 1989 repatriation of refugees in Nicaragua ' guerrilla activity virtually ceased.  The likelihood of protest is much higher than that of rebellion. Miskito still struggle to implement autonomy plans that have not been fully supported by the central government. Moreover, unemployment in the Mosquito region is over 50 percent, though this statistic is complicated by the fact that many indigenous communities are involved in subsistent farming, fishing, and mining on the Atlantic Coast. YATAMA members are very politically active  reaction to perceived government discrimination has included non-violent takeovers of government offices and airport.  No physical violence as been reported since 2004, but death threats against human rights workers advocating on behalf of the indigenous surfaced in 2006. Unless the Nicaraguan government makes a serious effort to address their concerns, sporadic protests seem likely. This is especially true for autonomy issues, around which mobilization is highly likely to continue."
47504,"The Ogoni have three of the risk factors associated with rebellion: a history of protest, territorial concentration and government repression. Nonetheless, they do not have a history of rebellion. Given that the group is very small and that the current government has taken some initiative, though delayed and limited in scope, to address their concerns, it is unlikely that militant activity will occur in the near future. The group does however have a long history of protest against the Nigerian government and the Shell Oil company. Factors encouraging protest include: a history of repression by the central government, environmental degradation due to natural resource extraction and exploitation, and economic marginalization."
77002,"Although Baluchis are fragmented politically, as well as by tribal and clan identities, they have several other factors placing them at risk for future rebellion: a history of political and economic discrimination as well as recent rebellious activity carried out by the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA). The transition from the Musharraf government in 2008 to a new government may change government relations with the Baluchis, but the instability of a democracy in transition may further put the group at risk. Furthermore, the continuation of violent conflict in Afghanistan adds to instability in Baluchistan and ensures a ready supply of cheap weaponry. Increasing Pashtun nationalism (which is responding to many of the same stimuli as Baluch nationalism) may also lead to tension between the Baluch and Pashtun residents of Baluchistan."
77005,"The Pashtun exhibit several of the risk factors for rebellion. They are territorially concentrated, and Pakistan's government has been unstable, as particularly demonstrated by the 1999 Musharraf coup. While the Pashtun have a strong identity, they are also highly factionalized, making concerted political action difficult. However, various Pashtun-based militias  most notably in recent years, the Taliban  have engaged in large-scale violent rebellion in recent years. Furthermore, conflict in Afghanistan continues to destabilize the border regions where Pashtuns are concentrated. The decades-long Pakistani involvement in the Afghan conflict has led to a culture of drugs and violence. With a new configuration in Afghanistan and Central Asia, and with newly developed road and rail links in the region, the possibility of a revival of the Greater Pakhtoonistan separatist movement cannot be ruled out.  Pashtun parties did join with other parties -- nationalist, secular and Islamic -- in demanding a return to democratic rule after the 1999 Musharraf coup. While a newly elected government is now in power, it has proven weak in the face of multiple internal challenges and has not demonstrated control over the security forces. If the Zardari coalition government  which includes the secular, Pashtun Awami party  is able to fulfill pledges of increased self-government and economic development for ethnic regions, Pashtun incentives for rebellion and protest will lessen. However, to be successful, such initiatives will have to be accompanied by improvements in physical security in Pashtun regions and de-legitimization of the Taliban and other militant organizations."
84003,"The Moros have five of the factors that increase the chances of future rebellion: persistent protest; current insurgency; territorial concentration; regime instability in the past five years; and recent government repression. Factors that could inhibit future rebellion include the Philippines' recent transition to democracy and transnational efforts by Libya and the Organization of the Islamic Conference not only to facilitate a settlement with the MILF but also to help ensure the full implementation of the 1996 agreement reached with the MNLF. More than 65,000 people have died since the violent conflict began in the early 1970s. MILF persistently filed official verbal protests against the Philippine military, while thousands of Muslims in the southern Philippines protested against religious discrimination and the Arroyo Administration more generally in both 2004 and 2005."
36002,"An ethnic Hungarian rebellion in Romania is unlikely based on four factors: there is a history of democratic government in Romania; the government is willing to negotiate and reform; transnational support exists for reform efforts; and although autonomy movements exist in neighboring countries, there is no armed conflict. However, the Szekler autonomy movement has grown in intensity since 2003, with groups from the Szekler region of Romania mobilizing for an autonomous 'Szeklerland. These actions contrast with the more moderate attitude of the leadership of the Hungarians main political group, the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania (UMDR), which the new autonomy groups claim has not done enough. The UMDR has pledged to pursue their limited autonomy demands through a gradual process, while the more radical movement is clamoring for a more rapid change in status. Tension between ethnic Hungarians and Romanian nationalists has increased with the amplified autonomy movement, but the government has been successful at diffusing tension by being willing to meet with representatives of the Szekler movement. Despite the political tension, both factions of the Hungarian rights movement are inclined toward cooperation and nonviolence between each other, the Romanian government and other groups in Romanian society. "
36531,"Although many feared that Lezgin demands for the creation of an independent ""Lezgistan"" would destabilize the fragile ethnic balance in Dagestan as well as relations between Russia and Azerbaijan, these fears have thus far proved to be unwarranted. By 2006 it appears less likely than ever that the Lezgins will resort to rebellion or sustained collective political action to address their grievances. They did not engage in any serious violence or protests between 1997 and 2006, and have shown a willingness to negotiate and compromise away their most intractable demands. Their nationalist movements do not receive wide support among the Lezgin people who are not well-organized on the grass-roots level, and who certainly do not want Dagestan to suffer the same fate as Chechnya. One potentially destabilizing factor is the struggling economy of the Lezgin regions. The Lezgin are among the most disadvantaged of the Dagestani groups, and there appears to be little effort to rectify the situation on the part of local officials. Sources report that unemployment among young Dagestani Lezgins is as much as 80%, due largely to the collapse of both the defense industry that was concentrated in their region and traditional Lezgin sheep herding. One suspects that these figures may be exaggerated, or that many Lezgins are supporting themselves in the ""unofficial economy"" that still thrives across the former Soviet Union. But if those unemployment numbers are close to reality, such large numbers of unemployed people in comparison to other groups may prove to be a tremendously destabilizing factor in the long run. The wars in Chechnya have had opposing effects on the Lezgins. On the one hand, the wars exacerbated the main Lezgin grievance, as the Samur River became a virtual wall dividing their people between Russia and Azerbaijan. However, the ferocity of the fighting seems to have discouraged militant Lezgins by convincing them (and many other Caucasian groups) that Moscow is determined to maintain a firm hold on its territories. Lezgin leaders seem to have concluded that the best route to change is a peaceful one. Of course the Lezgin grievances could be largely satisfied if the Russian government relaxes the tight border controls on the Samur.  The Lezgins in Dagestan seem to understand the fragility of the ethnic balance in their republic. In the last few years even the most ardent Lezgin nationalists have softened their demands. This recognition that their interest lies in peaceful social change bodes well for the prospects for stability in the region."
23001,"There is reason to believe that the militant activity of the ETA may decrease in the near future. ETA declared a 'permanent ceasefire and entered into talks with Spains Socialist-led government in March 2006, and expressed desire to emulate the IRAs path to legitimacy.  From May 2003 to December 2006, ETA employed only a low-level bombing campaign that included advanced warning for attacks and caused no fatalities.  However, an ETA bombing of a Madrid airport in December 2006 killed two men and effectively ended talks with the Spanish government.  The Basques have many of the risk factors which contribute to rebellious activity, including government repression, territorial concentration, and high levels of group organization and cohesion. While the Spanish government has granted the Basques extensive regional autonomy, many Basques want more autonomy from the Spanish central government and resent the presence of Spanish civil guards, Spanish businesses, and other intrusions into Basque life. Recently there has been significant cooperation between Spanish and French anti-terrorist authorities, and it has led to substantial success in finding and arresting many Basque militants, including key ETA leaders. Spanish authorities claim that the arrests have crippled the ETA and limited their ability to cause violence.  However, the presence of many risk factors and the December 2006 attack indicate that the ETA remains a threat to stability in the region. Due to many Basques strong commitment to independence,, there is no reason to think that non-militant political action will wind down. Public protest is a long-enshrined part of the Basques repertoire in dealing with the Spanish government. It is difficult to identify concessions the Spanish government might offer that would check the protests- short of independence, an idea that the Spanish Parliament overwhelmingly rejected in 2005.  The ETA has begun to direct some of its actions at other groups in Spain, notably the Catalans, who have responded with anti-Basques protests. There is also a backlash among Basques themselves against some of ETAs actions but this seems more likely to affect ETAs tactics than to end support for its long-term objective of independence. The other hope for ending Basque protests and militant activity is the Basque regional governments affiliation with the European Union, which gives it the opportunity to function autonomously in the international arena. However, this does not seem sufficient to satisfy the militants demand for full sovereignty."
23002,"There is no evidence to suggest that Catalans are likely to use militant strategies in their dealings with the Spanish government. All their interactions with the central government contain elements of power sharing or deal brokering. Their representatives cooperate with other parties in the Spanish parliament in seeking concessions for the Catalan region, and in 2005 the two main Catalan parties joined the coalition government of Spanish Prime Minister Luis Rodriguez Zapatero. Zaperto reciprocated by supporting a new Statute of Autonomy for Catalonia, which in 2006 gave the region greater autonomy in taxation and legal affairs. Catalans view their dealings with the Spanish in light of an ancient oath between their monarch and the Castilians. This is the principle of ""If not, not"": ""We who are as good as you, swear to you, who are no better than us, to accept you as our king and sovereign lord, provided you observe all our liberties and laws - but if not, not."" So long as they continue to have economic prosperity, regional autonomy, and effective parliamentary representation, there are no incentives for a resumption of terrorism. There is always the possibility of future protests however. The Catalans possess few of the risk factors for protest, such as political and cultural restrictions, violent repression, support from separatist kindred groups, etc. However, due to their strong identity and fierce autonomy, the Catalans will watch what concessions the Spanish government grants the Basques, and protest any concessions that they do not receive. There remains a sizable minority of Catalans'about 16 percent in 2005that support full independence from Spain.  Occasionally, these separatists will stage large protests in Barcelona.  In general however, the Catalans are satisfied with their increased autonomy, and the risk of violenceeven from separatistsis minimal."
22501,"There is little likelihood that Jurassians will support future rebellious activity. There have been no reports of protests for some time, and the issues of concern to Jurassian political organizations do not appear to be of much salience for the majority of the group. Both the German and French-speaking populations of the Jura appear to be content to work within the political system to pursue their goals. There also is little current concern in the rest of Switzerland about the Jura region. It should be noted however that while violence by militants in the past was limited and episodic, it may recur at any time. Also, information on the activities of the separatists is difficult to come by in the English-language press and it is possible that some relevant political activities are not being reported."
80002,"The Muslims in Thailand have four of the factors that increase the likelihood of maintaining the current rebellion: an active insurgency movement; territorial concentration; government repression of group members; and a history of lost autonomy. Factors that encourage the current rebellion include a history of neglect and marginalization against the Malay-Muslim community, possible foreign aid and/or recruitment to the rebellion movement, and the inability of the Thai government to shed its anti-Muslim reputation. A bloodless coup in September 2006, staged by the Thai Royal Army, disposed of a controversial and divisive Prime Minister. However, it remains to be seen if the new administration will be effective in tackling the issue of domestic reconciliation in the South. If any progress is to occur, the new regime must end corruption within its security forces and engage in active consensus-building with the Muslim community. Political restrictions, a new and potentially unstable regime, recent repression against the group, and budding kindred support continue to place the Malay-Muslim community at a risk for protest."
50003,"While the Baganda have a long history of seeking greater autonomy, there is little evidence of this escalating into rebellion despite recent protests. The most important factor inhibiting rebellion is that the government has made some attempts at negotiation and reform, through constitutional channels. Should these attempts not materialize into concrete steps, the situation may change.  While the Baganda do not face risk factors for protest such as political or economic discrimination, they do remain at risk for future protest especially in light of increasing demands for a federal system, which is often called Federo. Tensions have also risen due to recent calls for Kamapala to be recognized as part of the Buganda kingdom.  Currently, the situation of the Baganda in Uganda is stable: they are not targeted for abuse by the government or rebel groups. They are unlikely to force the issue of autonomy violently, but it will remain one of their key concerns around which to organize protests."
20004,"There is virtually no risk of Scottish militancy in the near future. Protest is not likely to rise beyond verbal opposition, although larger scale protest is possible, due to high levels of group cohesion. Outside of high levels of group cohesion, none of the risk factors usually associated with protest is present, but the nature of British democracy is such that the Scots can use protest as part of their repertoire without fear of repression or other sanctions. Without the power to set their own tax rates, they cannot rid themselves of taxes imposed by the central government, nor can they use tax incentives to improve local living standards or to promote regional development. In other words, while the central government has granted limited autonomy, many of the English-Scottish chafing points remain. Scotland has recently turned to the European Union as an alternative route for pursuing Scottish interests, and this could lead to increased tensions between Scotland and the UK government. The Scots, like other large minorities such as the Basques in Spain, have used the EU to circumvent their state government. By dealing directly with the EU, the Scots and the British government are treated basically as equals or at least separate regions within the union, allowing the Scots to preserve their culture and economic interests without British interference. While disagreements remain, it should be noted that the devolution of powers to Scotland has occurred relatively smoothly, and there appears to be a commitment from both sides to continue the process in a timely and effective manner."
70402,"Risk of Tajik rebellion is moderate to low. While the group is territorially concentrated and faces a degree of discrimination from the regime, Tajiks have lacked significant political organization since 1994, relying instead on cultural associations. There have been no incidents of recent political violence carried out by the group, and protest has been very low. However, this lack of political activity is likely more to do with the strict authoritarian policies of the Uzbek government than a lack of grievances. Perhaps the sole achievement of which the ethnic Tajiks can boast is the official recognition of their status as a separate nationality group, but this was arguably more of a legacy of Soviet nationality policies than successful political lobbying. The regime in neighboring Tajikistan has shown no willingness to support irredentist policies of Tajiks in Uzbekistan, which further undermines Tajiks' ability to oppose the state violently. One area of increasing concern for the regime is not Tajik nationalism, but rather an overarching Islamic identity, which some believe could pose a significant challenge now or in the future.  While the risk is small in the near future, unless Tajik cultural and political grievances are successfully addressed, they remain a potential target for mobilization against the Karimov regime."
34507,"There is little risk of Croats in Serbia rebelling against the government of Serbia. While the Croats are primarily concentrated in Vojvodina around Subotica and are fairly well organized, they are a very small minority in Serbia. They occasionally voice verbal protest against the central government, but there is little risk of these escalating in the future. The government exercises no official repression of Croats in Serbia and has established a council on national minorities to ensure that they are adequately protected. While the government of Croatia occasionally voices rhetorical support for Croats in Serbia and has signed an agreement for the protection of national minorities with Serbia, it takes great pains not to interfere in the domestic affairs of its neighbors. So, while Croats would certainly find safe haven in Croatia if there were a need, the message is clear that any Croat-initiated violence in Serbia, or anywhere else in the region for that matter, would be condemned. Croats experience mild informal discrimination in Serbia, but this is mostly economic and they claim in some cases cultural, but there is no official effort by the government to restrict their political participation or enjoyment of cultural heritage."
34505,"While the post-Milosevic political system in Yugoslavia and then Serbia and Montenegro and then just Serbia has improved conditions for nearly all minorities in the country, Sandzak Bosniaks remain disadvantaged in many ways, and the Sandzak region has seen both intercommunal and intracommunal violence. Sandzak Bosniaks are territorially concentrated in the Sandzak, a region in south eastern Serbia and Montenegro. Nevertheless many of the previous overt discriminations against them have been removed, and they hold numerous national and regional political posts. But despite all of these changes, the Sandzak Muslims are dissatisfied with their standing in the country. While some extremists have called for an independent Sandzak, especially in light of the Montenegrin referendum for independence which split the Sandzak into two countries, the primary split among Sandzak Bosniaks is between those who see engaging in Serbia as the key to improvement of their standing and those who think that engagement with Serbs is fruitless and who want official autonomy.  Although sporadic violence plagues the Sandzak, it is very unlikely that the Bosniaks will engage in rebellion. As of 2000 with the ousting of Slobodan Milosevic, the regime in the country liberalized substantially, and although reforms remain in progress, the democratic process improved substantially. Additionally, the federal government created the post of Federal Minister for Minority Affairs in 2001, which was filled by Rasim Ljajic, a Sandzak Muslim leader. Finally, the region itself has been relatively conflict free since the end of the conflict in Kosovo in 1999.  Sandzak Bosniaks face few official political or cultural restrictions but do face informal discrimination and restrictions. While Sandzak Bosniaks have kin across the border in Bosnia and Herzegovina, there does not appear to be much more than moral support coming into the Sandzak for the Bosniaks there. "
